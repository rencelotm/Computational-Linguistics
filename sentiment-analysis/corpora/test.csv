"<p>I would like to run a process in a thread (which is iterating over a large database table). While the thread is running, I just want the program to wait. If that thread takes longer then 30 seconds, I want to kill the thread and do something else. By killing the thread, I mean that I want it to cease activity and release resources gracefully.</p>

<p>I figured the best way to do this was through a <code>Thread()</code>'s <code>join(delay)</code> and <code>is_alive()</code> functions, and an <code>Event</code>. Using the <code>join(delay)</code> I can have my program wait 30 seconds for the thread to finish, and by using the <code>is_alive()</code> function I can determine if the thread has finished its work. If it hasn't finished its work, the event is set, and the thread knows to stop working at that point.</p>

<p>Is this approach valid, and is this the most pythonic way to go about my problem statement?</p>

<p>Here is some sample code:</p>

<pre><code>import threading
import time

# The worker loops for about 1 minute adding numbers to a set
# unless the event is set, at which point it breaks the loop and terminates
def worker(e):
    data = set()
    for i in range(60):
        data.add(i)
        if not e.isSet():
            print ""foo""
            time.sleep(1)
        else:
            print ""bar""
            break

e = threading.Event()
t = threading.Thread(target=worker, args=(e,))
t.start()

# wait 30 seconds for the thread to finish its work
t.join(30)
if t.is_alive():
    print ""thread is not done, setting event to kill thread.""
    e.set()

"<p>To give a little context to my issue...</p>

<p>I have a Java EE web application (as a UI / client) that accesses services for data / business logic via a REST interface using the JAX-RS 2.0 client API (Resteasy implementation).</p>

<p>Currently I inject a new JAXRS Client instance per request using a RequestScoped CDI managed bean, the thinking being that the client app may call multiple backend resources per request and I reuse the same JAXRS Client for the whole request (although I read somewhere this may not be correct as I am potentially changing the URI for each invocation)</p>

<p>The documentation for JAXRS Client seems to suggest that the client is a potentially expensive operation and the app should limit the amount of connections it creates.  It also seems to contradict itself and suggest the client should be closed once all the requests to a particular WebTarget are finished.</p>

<p>The client application could potentially support thousands of simultaneous users  so creating and destroying thousands of 'expensive clients' does not seem to be the correct approach so am thinking a shared client pool is more appropriate but there doesn't seem to be any information on how this should be achieved.</p>

<p>All examples appear to show creating a new client for the request and a) closing it after or b) not closing it but not really explaining what happens on a second request.</p>

<p>Can you help provide some answers on how you think this would be solved or information on what the best practice for this approach is.</p>

"<p>My company is currently making an Android application for a local $BigCarManufacturer dealer.

"<p>I have a rails application in which I use foreman to start my rails and sidekiq servers. Since foreman doesn't interact well with regular byebug (you can't see the prompt as you type), I have set up remote debugging for both my rails and sidekiq servers.

"Let us consider we have two classes A and B. B is a sub class for A because B extends A. If We create an instance of A Class and assign that in to a A type will contains all the properties of A. Similarly when I create an Instance of B and assign it to B type will get all the properties of B along with properties of A because it is inheriting from A. According to above lines instance of A contains properties a few as compared to properties contains to instance B. That means Instance of B is Bigger than Instance of A.

"<p>When working with Spring Boot to build micro-services its very easy to write extensive and very readable integration tests and mock remote service requests with <code>MockRestServiceServer</code>.</p>

<p>Is there a way to use similar approach to perform additional integration test on <code>ZuulProxy</code>? What I would like to achieve is being able to mock remote servers that <code>ZuulProxy</code> would forward to and validate that all of my <code>ZuulFitler</code>s behaved as expected. However, <code>ZuulProxy</code> is using <code>RestClient</code> from Netflix (deprecated it would seem?) which naturally does not use <code>RestTemplate</code> which could be re-configured by <code>MockRestServiceServer</code> and I currently can't find a good way of mocking responses from remote services for proxied requests.</p>

<p>I have a micro-service that is responsible for handling API Session Key creation and then will act similar to an API Gateway. Forwarding is done with Zuul Proxy to underlying exposed services, and Zuul Filters will detect if Session key is valid or not. An integration test would therefore create a valid session and then forward to a fake endpoint, e.g 'integration/test'.</p>

<p>Specifying that 'integration/test' is a new endpoint is possible by setting a configuration property on <code>@WebIntegrationTest</code>, I can successfully mock all services that are being handled via <code>RestTemplate</code> but not Zuul forwarding.</p>

<p>What's the best way to do achieve mocking of a forward target service?</p>

"<p>So I have an app currently on the app store that schedules 10 notifications in advance assuming you miss one you will still get a second chance or ten. Now before you think I will be bothering the person, the notification is very important to the functionality of the app and really is the main purpose. The app was built for iOS 7 so at that time there was no ""handleActionWithIdentifier"" which can, from my understanding, complete actions for the app even if it is closed depending on the users response to the notification. This update was very helpful for the app as it eliminates part of my problem of having to open the app to respond to the notification (the notifications ask the user a question and depending on the answer, completes something).</p>

<p>The problem that remains is detecting if the notification was missed, how would I make another notification appear, for example the next day, if the notification is dismissed or ignored. I have searched this on google and stack overflow and from my understanding all previous questions have been asking how to detect if the notification was missed one the app is opened which I do not need.</p>

<p>At this point, I can properly run code if the user responds to the notification by pressing one of the options on the notification by this :</p>

<pre><code>func application(application: UIApplication, handleActionWithIdentifier identifier: String?, forLocalNotification notification: UILocalNotification, withResponseInfo responseInfo: [NSObject : AnyObject], completionHandler: () -&gt; Void) {
        var userInfo = [NSObject: AnyObject]()

        print(userInfo)

        completionHandler()
    }
</code></pre>

<p>as of right now, I am just taking textfield input and printing it but I could launch a second notification if I wanted. Is there a method to detecting when a notification is missed and scheduling another notification?</p>

<p>There is always a chance that it is still not possible to do what I want and I would just schedule 10 notifications in advance which seems sloppy and does not let me make the response as iterative.</p>

<p>TLDR; how do I detect and run code if a local notification is missed WITHOUT opening the app</p>

"<p>Is there a way to find out which imports are taking the longest in Python?

<li><a href=""https://github.com/angular/i18n"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://github.com/angular/i18n</a></li>
</ul>

<p>However last commit is more than 5 months old... Doesn't look like active development. </p>

<p>Anyone tried using angular-translate or angular-gettext? Or maybe with Angular2 it's better to wrap something JS like i18next? Anyone could share their thoughts? Maybe you faced the same problem? </p>

"<p>In Scala, I can use <code>Await</code> to wait for a future to complete.  However, if I have registered a callback to run upon completion of that future, how can I wait not only for the future to complete but also for that callback to finish?</p>

<p>Here is a minimal but complete program to illustrate the problem:</p>

<pre><code>import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global
import scala.concurrent.duration.Duration
import scala.concurrent.{ Await, Future }

object Main {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val f: Future[Int] = Future(0)
    f.onSuccess { case _ =&gt;
      Thread.sleep(10000)

    // This waits for `f` to complete but doesn't wait for the callback
    // to finish running.

<p>I expect the output to be:</p>

<pre><code>The program waited patiently for this callback to finish.

"<p>I would like to achive the following layout:</p>

<ol>
<li>Map as a base layout</li>
<li>Transparent window above inside a CollapsingToolbarLayout</li>
<li>RecyclerView for content</li>
</ol>

<p>I included an example of how this should look like.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2gpph.png""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2gpph.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I was following this great example from  <a href=""https://github.com/chrisbanes/cheesesquare"">Cheesesquare</a> for the CollapsingToolbarLayout and AppBarLayout implementation. I managed to get the content working with the map inside the CollapsingToolbarLayout (commented out in the layout xml), but this is not the desired result.</p>

<p>However I did not find any solution / documentation to make the grey box (see inside image in the middle) to be transparent in the initial position. I would like it to be transparent in order to see through to the map. When the user would scroll up, the CollapsingToolbarLaoyut should do it's work and collapse the transparent window and show the Toolbar. For now the image looks just white or whatever color I give it. I already tried to set the color to transparent, but it didn't have the desired effect.</p>

<p><strong>So my question</strong>: <em>How could I set the ""CollapsingToolbarLayout"" transparent in the initial phase (see image Layer 1 grey box)?</em></p>

<p>Here is my code for the layout. The CollapsingToolbarLayout works great, but I can't see the map below. Would be great if it would be possible to implement. </p>

<p>The Spring Cloud reference documentation currently says: ""Building on Spring Boot and Spring Security OAuth2 we can quickly create systems that implement common patterns like single sign on, token relay and <strong>token exchange</strong>."" (<a href=""http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-security/spring-cloud-security.html"">http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-security/spring-cloud-security.html</a>)</p>

<p>I guess that with ""Token Exchange"" in the reference documentation they mean the implementation of this extension of OAuth2, explained in this spec, which is basically what I need:
<a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-token-exchange-03"">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-token-exchange-03</a></p>

<p>As I said, I understand how to use SSO and Token Relay but I'm not able to see further explanation about how to implement ""Token exchange"" in the reference documentation. I was not able to find an implementation example either.</p>

<p>Does anyone know where I can find further information or an example?</p>

"<p>I'm updating an embedded TLS 1.0 implementation to TLS 1.2 (devices with 1MB of code space or less, and no OS).  At this point, I have AES-128 and AES-256 CBC ciphers working with SHA-1 and SHA-256 digests for a minimal implementation.

"<p>In my model I have a Recipe entity and Ingredient entity. In Recipe entity, the relation is defined like this:</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * @ORM\ManyToOne(targetEntity=""Recipe"", inversedBy=""ingredients"")
 * @ORM\JoinColumn(name=""recipe_id"", referencedColumnName=""id"")
 */
private $recipe;
</code></pre>

<p>I am working on CRUD controller for the recipe and I want the user to be able to add ingredients dynamically. I also want the user to drag-and-drop ingredients to set their priority (order) in the recipe. I am using CollectionType form field for this.</p>

<p>and this page as tutorial:</p>

<p><a href=""http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/form/form_collections.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/form/form_collections.html</a></p>

<p>Adding and showing of the recipe are working perfectly so far, however there is a problem with Edit/Update action, which I will try to describe below:</p>

<p>In the controller, I load the entity and create the form like this:</p>

<pre><code>  public function updateAction($id, Request $request)
  {
      $em = $this-&gt;getDoctrine()-&gt;getManager();
      $recipe = $em-&gt;getRepository('AppBundle:Recipe')-&gt;find($id);


      $form = $this-&gt;createEditForm($recipe);
      $form-&gt;handleRequest($request);

      ...

    }
</code></pre>

<p>Since the priority is saved in the DB, and I have <code>@ORM\OrderBy({""priority"" = ""ASC""})</code>, the initial loading and display of ingredients works fine. However if the user drags and drops ingredients around, the priority values change. In case there are form validation errors and the form needs to be displayed repeatedly, ingredients inside the form get displayed in the old order, even though priority values are updated.</p>

<p>For example, I have the following initial Ingredient => priority values in DB:</p>

<ul>
<li>A => 1</li>
<li>B => 2</li>
<li>C => 3</li>
</ul>

<p>The form rows are displayed in order: A,B,C;</p>

<p>After user changes the order, I have:</p>

<ul>
<li>B => 1</li>
<li>A => 2</li>
<li>C => 3</li>
</ul>

<p>but the form rows are still displayed as A,B,C;</p>

<p>I understand that the form has been initialized with order A,B,C, and updating <code>priority</code> doesn't change the element order of ArrayCollection. But I have (almost) no idea how to change it.</p>

<p>What I have tried so far:</p>

<pre><code>$form-&gt;getData();
// sort in memory
$form-&gt;setData();
</code></pre>

<p>This doesn't work, as apparently it isn't allowed to use setData() on form which already has input.</p>

<p>I have also tried to set a DataTransformer to order the rows, but the form ignores new order.</p>

<p>I have also tried to use PRE/POST submit handlers in the FormType class to order the rows, however the form still ignores the new order.</p>

<p>The last thing that (kind of) works is this:</p>

<p>In Recipe entity, define <code>sortIngredients()</code> method which sorts ArrayCollection in memory,</p>

<pre><code>  public function sortIngredients()
  {
      $sort = \Doctrine\Common\Collections\Criteria::create();
      $sort-&gt;orderBy(Array(
          'priority' =&gt; \Doctrine\Common\Collections\Criteria::ASC
      ));

      $this-&gt;ingredients = $this-&gt;ingredients-&gt;matching($sort);

      return $this;
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Then, in the controller:</p>

<pre><code>  $form = $this-&gt;createEditForm($recipe);
  $form-&gt;handleRequest($request);

  $recipe-&gt;sortIngredients();

  // repeatedly create and process form with already sorted ingredients
  $form = $this-&gt;createEditForm($recipe);
  $form-&gt;handleRequest($request);

  // ... do the rest of the controller stuff, flush(), etc
</code></pre>

<p>This works, but the form is created and processed twice, and honestly it looks like a hack... </p>

"any help is greatly appreciated.  I have a cisco voice gateway that I connect to with SSH and can send a command to get all the current calls on the gateway.  I'm trying to automate this so that I can pull out this information and display it on a big screen tv in an area that needs to see the current active calls at any given moment.

I've got the automated part down already, it will connect to the gateway and pull out the command results in a text file.  Sample output is below.  

I am trying to find a way, perhaps with powershell, or something else, to parse this text file, and just extract 2 pieces of information: calling# and called# so I can display it in a web page.  The problem is that I need to remove a lot of the headers and stuff and also, the number of callers is not fixed, there can be 0 callers, or 10+ calls at any given time.

Any suggestions on how I may be able to automate this?

"I have read on this great forum and several other places how difficult, if not impossible to decrypt with md5.

Unfortunately, I used md5 to has our users' passwords:

     // hash to sanitize the input further
    $password = md5($password);

Now, I am a bit of trouble because users who cannot remember their passwords, are not able to utilize our Recover password feature.

When they attempt to recover their password, they receive the encrypted password which is useless to them because they can't use it.

Given how difficulty, almost impossible it is to decrypt an md5 hash, is there a simpler encryption / decryption mechanism that someone could suggest that I try?

Pretty much in hot water now.

I've tried using ruby 2.2.0, but it doesn't make a difference.

"<p>I had to update Spring from 1.2.7 to 2.0, as well Grails from <strong>2.2.0 to 2.3.11</strong>. After solving a few typical update problems, I started to build a WAR to the testing server. Everything seemed ok. But after a few deployments I encountered a problem.</p>

<p>Sometimes (there is no rule) the server has 100% CPU usage -> OutOfMemeryError or application throws error 500. After debugging, I noticed that the reason for these problems is incorrect SQL query.</p>

<p>Where query:</p>

<pre><code>UserRole.find{role.authority =~ ""%${authTxt}"" &amp;&amp; user.id == currentUser.id}
</code></pre>

<p>creates such SQL:</p>

<pre><code>select this_.id as id1_35_2_, this_.payment_enabled as payment_2_35_2_, this_.role_id as role_id3_35_2_, this_.user_id as user_id4_35_2_,
role_alias1_.id as id1_29_0_, role_alias1_.version as version2_29_0_, role_alias1_.authority as authorit3_29_0_, user_alias2_.id as id1_36_1_,
user_alias2_.version as version2_36_1_, user_alias2_.account_expired as account_3_36_1_, user_alias2_.account_locked as account_4_36_1_, 
user_alias2_.auto_password_flag as auto_pas5_36_1_, user_alias2_.email as email6_36_1_, user_alias2_.enabled as enabled7_36_1_, 
user_alias2_.""password"" as password8_36_1_, user_alias2_.password_expired as password9_36_1_, user_alias2_.user_info_id
as user_in10_36_1_, user_alias2_.username as usernam11_36_1_ from user_role this_ inner join role role_alias1_ on this_.role_id=role_alias1_.id inner join users user_alias2_ 
on this_.user_id=user_alias2_.id where (1=1 and 1=1)
</code></pre>

<p>and here the correct SQL:</p>

<pre><code>... inner join role role_alias1_ on this_.role_id=role_alias1_.id inner join users user_alias2_ on this_.user_id=user_alias2_.id 
where ((role_alias1_.authority ilike ?) and (user_alias2_.id=?)) 
</code></pre>

<p>The obvious problem is that expression <strong>""(1 = 1 and 1 = 1)""</strong>. In fact, such query: </p>

<pre><code>User.findAll {id == userid} 
</code></pre>

<p>retrieve the entire table. <strong>Dynamic finders or criteria does not cause this problem.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I changed Grails version to 2.4</li>
<li>I changed Hibernate3 to Hibernate4</li>
<li>I changed the connector to Postgres from 9.0-801.jdbc3 to 9.1-901-1.jdbc4</li>
<li>I removed the dependencies to see if any of them does not cause a problem</li>
<li>I checked whether the extracted WAR does not differ in any file</li>
<li>I changed Java version</li>
<li>I changed Tomcat version</li>
<li>I tested on another system</li>
</ul>

<p>From what I read on a blog which link I gave above, Graeme Rocher wrote that the problem may be due to a lack of GORM in the application. However, the problem was there during the building of WAR - dependencies were wrongly packed(?). But here the problem arises when WAR is unpacking or when classes are loading. Looking at the source of the problem from blog entry, shows that the problem may be due to some ridiculous reason ...</p>

<p>Does anyone have an idea what might cause this problem or what can I debug to be able to determine the source of the error?
And the question to grails dev: what has changed between version 2.2 and 2.3 that theoretically could cause such a problem?</p>

"<p>I have a Component that acts as a Search Bar. It can make api requests and provide the results to the rest of the app through an <code>@Output</code> and <code>EventEmitter</code> but I also want a function to go the other way. The Search Bar component keeps a history of it's searches and I would like to provide a way for the parent component to clear the history. The best I can think of is to somehow call a method in my Search Bar from a parent component.</p>

<p>The best I've come up with (but haven't been able to properly implement) is to try to pass an <code>EventEmitter</code> INTO my Search Bar and the child subscribes to the parent's events. The <code>@Input</code> hasn't completed binding by the time the constructor though so it gets tricky to actually do this.</p>

<p>I suppose I could try and store the history in the parent component, but the reason the Search Bar is a component is because it will appear in multiple places and this doesn't fit with Separation of Concerns so it seems best to keep the history in the Search Bar component.</p>

"I was just going through the `c-faq`, when I came across [this](http://c-faq.com/struct/retcrash.html) page. I stated that the following program will have a core dump:

    struct list {
		char *item;
		struct list *next;
	}

	/* Here is the main program. */

	main(argc, argv)
	{}

The reason they told for the core dump to happen was:

>A missing semicolon at the end of the structure declaration causes main to be declared as returning a structure. (The connection is hard to see because of the intervening comment.) Since structure-valued functions are usually implemented by adding a hidden return pointer (see question 2.9), the generated code for main() tries to accept three arguments, although only two are passed (in this case, by the C start-up code). See also questions 10.9 and 16.4.

Although, when I ran this program online over [here](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_c_online.php), it worked perfectly and the program did run till the end. Also, when I compiled this program using gcc, I got no warnings.

I was surprised, as the program should have not runned till the end. Can someone tell me why this program works? If it is correct, why is it mentioned that the program will not work (any chance it might crash?).

"<p>Our apps are being developed for both Android and iOS. We are using AWS SNS Mobile Push to push messages to both GCM and APNS. The back end is PHP and so it uses the AWS PHP SDK.</p>

<p>Until now, our system has been saving 1 Endpoint ARN per user. We then broadcast a Mobile Push message directly to this Endpoint ARN.</p>

<p>The question:</p>

<p>It would be strange if a user were logged into our app on multiple devices and did not receive push notifications on all of them. So - we're going to have to change something.</p>

<p>How, in AWS Mobile Push, is the concept of 'one user, multiple devices (and potentially multiple platforms) handled?</p>

<p>Does our system have to maintain a one-to-many association of user-to-EndpointARNs (i.e. start saving multiple EndpointARNs per user so that we may push messages to all of them sequentially)?</p>

<p>Or should I be looking into the 'Topics' concept that Mobile Push provides (I'm confused here - do some people use one topic per <em>user</em>, and then push messages to the topic itself?)..</p>

<p>Lastly - I guess as a bonus question - is it normal for people using the PHP AWS SDK to include both <code>APNS</code> <em>and</em> <code>GCM</code> attributes in the <code>Message</code> payload array? We haven't been keeping track of 'which type of device each user uses'. We've just been saving an Endpoint ARN per user.

<p>I've been doing a lot of searching on the 'one user with multiple devices' topic re: Mobile Push with AWS SNS, and really the results have been quite unhelpful. </p>

"I am presently learning SDL2, and I made several programs with it. 
With these programs, when I double-click on the executable, the program launches, and everything is okay. 
On the last program I made, it doesn't work anymore. With this one, I can only launch from terminal.

"<p>SO has many articles mentioning this error code:</p>

<pre><code>FastCGI sent in stderr: ""Primary script unknown"" while reading response header from upstream...

<p>The message is telling us that the FastCGI handler doesn't like whatever it was sent for some reason.  The problem is that sometimes we have no idea what the reason is.</p>

<p>So I'm re-stating the question -- How do we <strong><em>debug</em></strong> this error code?</p>

<p>Consider the situation where we have a very simple site, with just the phpinfo.php file.  Additionally, there is a very simple nginx config, as follows:</p>

<pre><code>server {
    server_name testsite.local;

    root /var/local/mysite/;

    location / {
        index index.html index.htm index.php;

        fastcgi_index index.php;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>How can we see output/log exactly what fastcgi_params got sent to the script?</strong></p>

<p><strong>How can we see the actual error message?</strong>  In my case, I'm using php-fpm.  It has no info in the log about this error.  The logs do not append any rows for this error.  Is there a verbose mode for php-fpm?</p>

I'm new to AWS and was looking for a bucket policy to enable my ec2 servers access to the S3 buckets on the same account. I tried using this policy which enables the account:

But I got access denied on the ec2.
I've found this:

   ""Principal"": { ""Service"": [ ""ec2.amazonaws.com"", ""datapipeline.amazonaws.com""       ] }

"<p>I have a <code>Cart</code> model and a <code>CartItem</code> model. The <code>CartItem</code> model has a <code>ForeignKey</code> to the <code>Cart</code> model.</p>

<p>Using Django Rest Framework I have a view where the API user can display the <code>Cart</code>, and obviously then I want to include the <code>CartItem</code> in the respone. </p>

<p>I set up my Serializer like this:</p>

<pre><code>class CartSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    user = UserSerializer(read_only=True)
    cartitem_set = CartItemSerializer(read_only=True)
    class Meta:
        model = Cart
        depth = 1
        fields = (
            'id', 
            'user', 
            'date_created', 
            'voucher', 
            'carrier', 
            'currency', 
            'cartitem_set', 
        )
</code></pre>

<p>My problem is the second line, <code>cartitem_set = CartItemSerializer(read_only=True)</code>.</p>

<p>I get AttributeErrors saying <code>'RelatedManager' object has no attribute 'product'</code>.  ('product' is a field in the <code>CartItem</code> model. If I exclude product from the <code>CartItemSerializer</code> I just get a new AttributeError with the next field and so on. No matter if I only leave 1 or all fields in the Serializer, I will get a error.</p>

<p>My guess is that for some reason Django REST Framework does not support adding Serializers to reverse relationships like this. Am I wrong? How should I do this?</p>

<p>PS</p>

<p>The reason why I want to use the <code>CartItemSerializer()</code> is because I want to have control of what is displayed in the response.</p>

"[Store data function image][1] [Display data function and constructor image][2]

Hi,
   I'm new to c++ programming so any help would be really appreciated. So I've written two member functions for a class. The purpose of one of them is to store the integer data in a class data member array and the other ones is to display that data from that array. Now the problem i'm facing is that after storing the data in an array and call that display function to print that data, the initialized values(which are 0s) gets printed while when I put the task of printing data in the same function that stores that data the modified values print correctly. Can anyone tell why is that and how can I get display function to print the values.
  Again I would really appreciate any help.

"<p>I'm trying to wrap my head around best practice when using Observables alongside <code>ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush</code>.</p>

<p>The example demonstrates the common scenario of wanting to show some kind of loading message (or a simple spinner animation perhaps):</p>

<pre><code>@Component({
  selector: 'my-app',

  // Obviously ""Default"" will notice the change in `loadingMessage`...
  // changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.Default

  // But what is best practice when using OnPush?
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush
})
export class App implements OnInit {

  private loadingMessage = ""Wait for it..."";

  }

  ngOnInit() {

    // Pretend we're loading data from a service.
    // This component is only interested in the call's success
    Observable.of(true)
      .delay(2000)
      .subscribe(success =&gt; {

        if(success){
          console.log('Pretend loading: success!');

          // OnPush won't detect this change

  }

<p>I more or less understand the requirement for immutability with <code>OnPush</code> and, to me at least, it currently makes sense when talking about actual model data (likely held in some kind of store). </p>

<p>So, I have two questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Why doesn't the assignment of the new string value <code>'Success!'</code> trigger the change detector? As far as immutability is concerned, the value has changed, right?</li>
<li>How should lightweight internal component state (ie. <code>loadingMessage</code>) be implemented when using <code>ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush</code>? If there are multiple best practices, please point me in the right direction.</li>

"Here is the question:
Let us calculate sum of digits, as earlier, but multiplying each digit by its position (counting from the left, starting from 1). For example, given the value 1776 we calculate such weighted sum of digits (let us call it ""wsd"") as:

wsd(1776) = 1 * 1 + 7 * 2 + 7 * 3 + 6 * 4 = 60

Here is my code:

    digitlist = []
    numlist = []
    def splitdigit(number):
        numlist = []
        digitlist = []
        numlist.append(number)
        while number >= 1:
            number = number/10
            numlist.append(number)
        del numlist[-1]
        for ele in numlist:
            digitlist.append(ele%10)
        return digitlist
    # digit part

    # test if the split digit work here:
    # print (splitdigit(1234))  it works
    times = int(input())
    raw = raw_input()
    string = raw.split()
    nlist = []
    outbox = []
    rout = 0
    res = 0
    n = 0


    for item in string:
        nlist.append(int(item))
    # print (nlist) [it worked]
    for element in nlist:

        # formula to make the digit work: n = len(out) | while(n>1): n=n-1 
        # rout=out[-n]*n res=res+rout(res=0)
        n = len(splitdigit(element))
        print (n)
        res = 0
        while n >= 1:
            rout = (splitdigit(element)[(n*(-1))]) * n     # I HAVEN""T CHECK THIS FORMULA OUT !!!

"Probably a basic question; sorry and thank you for your help:
I have an object with one of its properties being an array of bytes. I assign that property to object called obj1. Basically, when I assign that property to a variable, it acquires the {System.Byte[]} type which is an object, not an array. As a result, I cannot access it. Problem is, whoever wrote the class did not define any .GetValue() method, so, I cannot really access the elements, but the debugger watch shows the values! The only methods defined for that object are ""Equals"" ""GetType"" and ""ToString"" (which returns ""System.Byte"" and not the values). I have tried the following without any luck:

var vals = (System.Byte[])obj1    //Returns a {System.Byte[]} object

var vals = (obj1 as System.Byte[])   //Returns a {System.Byte[]} object

var vals = obj1.GetValue           //Complains that GetValue is not defined

It is driving me crazy that I can see the array values using the watch window, but, am having trouble accessing the elements.

<p>I know about IdlingResource but as I read, espresso waits out of the box till the main-thread and AsyncTaskPool is idle before running any tests.</p>

<p>For getting in touch with it I crated a simple app containing two activities, a splashscreen and a mainactivity.
The splashscreen contains something like this for waiting for three sec before starting mainActivity</p>

<pre><code> new Handler().postDelayed(new Runnable() {
   @Override
   public void run() {
     finish();
     Intent intent = new Intent(SplashScreenActivity.this, MainActivity.class);
     startActivity(intent);
   }
 }, 3000);

<pre><code>onView(withText(""DummyText"")).check(matches(notNullValue()));
</code></pre>

"<p>I previously asked a long question regarding the security of JWT tokens but I want to focus specifically on JWT token revocation here. I am using JWT as my primary authentication mechanism for authenticating mobile clients of a mobile application. My question is: Is it worth implementing token revocation? Currently, I am using a short lifetime for my tokens and I am relying on TLS to prevent tokens from being stolen by unauthorized users. I have not implemented token revocation. But basically this means that if a token is stolen somehow, there is no way to revoke it. What concerns me more is that when a user logs out of the application, the last token they were using still works if I can't revoke it. And it also means that I cannot place a limit on the number of tokens a user can request since I'm not keeping track of any tokens that are issued. I've seen many applications that just store all issued tokens in the database, allowing them to revoke and regulate tokens. But this just seems to defeat the purpose of using JWT. Is it worth adding such complexity or is my current system secure? </p>

"<p>For a couple of days, we often see an extremely long initial connection time (15s - 1.3 minutes) to our ELBs when making any request via ssl. 
Oddly, I was only able to observe this in Google Chrome (not Safari nor Firefox nor curl). </p>

<p>It does not occur every single request, but around 50% of requests. It occurs with the first request (OPTIONS-call).</p>

<p>Our setup is the following:
Cross-Zone ELB that connects to a node.js backend (currently in 2 AZs in eu-west-1). All instances are healthy and once the request comes through, it is processed normally. Currently, there is basically no load on the system. Cloudwatch for ELB does not report any backend connection errors, neither a  SurgeQueue (value 0) nor a spillover count. The ELB metrics show a low latency (&lt; 100 ms).
We have Route53 configured to route to the ELB (we don't see any dns trouble, see attached screenshot).</p>

<p>We have different REST-APIs that all have this setup. It occurs to all of the ELBs (each of them is connecting to an indipendent node.js backend). All of these ELBs are set up the same way via our cloudformation template.</p>

<p>The ELBs also do our SSL-termination. </p>

<p>What could lead to such a behavior? Is it possible that the ELBs are not configured properly? And why could it only appear on Google Chrome?</p>

"<p>I'd like to use OpenStreetMap tiles in my React Native app on Android, so I'm trying to wrap the OSMDroid native UI component as described <a href=""https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/native-components-android.html#content"" rel=""noreferrer"">here.</a> For the most part it's working fine, but I'm having trouble figuring out how to correctly handle events, specifically <code>onScroll</code> and <code>onZoom</code>. </p>

<p>With OSMDroid, you set a DelayedMapListener to handle the events, which is pretty straightforward. I've confirmed that events are being handle correctly Java-side up until the point where the JS code should be triggered. However, they're not triggering my JavaScript code.</p>

<p>Based on <a href=""https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/native-components-android.html#events"" rel=""noreferrer"">the documentation</a>, I've implemented the event handlers in Java in the <code>createViewInstance</code> method of my view manager:</p>

<pre><code>map.setMapListener(new DelayedMapListener(new MapListener() {
    public boolean onScroll(ScrollEvent event) {
        WritableMap eventData = Arguments.createMap();

        // Fill in eventData; details not important

        ReactContext reactContext = (ReactContext)map.getContext();
        reactContext.getJSModule(RCTEventEmitter.class).receiveEvent(
            map.getId(),
            ""topChange"",
             eventData);

        return true;
    }

    public boolean onZoom(ZoomEvent event) {
        // Basically the same as above
    }
}, 100));
</code></pre>

<p>The relevant part of my JS code is basically identical to the code in the documentation linked above: </p>

<pre><code>class OSMDroidMapView extends Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this._onChange = this._onChange.bind(this);
    }

    _onChange(event: Event) {
        console.log(event);
        // Handle event data
    }

    render() {
        return &lt;OSMDroidMapView {...this.props} onChange={this._onChange}/&gt;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>There are no errors or any signs that anything is wrong. The Java event handler code is called correctly. There's just no sign of anything happening in the JS code when an event occurs. Does anyone know how to do this correctly? I feel like I must be missing some basic concept here.</p>

"<p>I'm trying to workout if it is something I am doing wrong, or its an issue in moq or NUnit. I am calling a soap endpoint and my service reference is generating both sync and async methods.  The call I am making, looks something like:</p>

    await ws.DoSomethingAsync(myobj, id);

Here is function code `function shuffle( array ) {	// Shuffle an array
	// 
	// +   original by: Jonas Raoni Soares Silva (http://www.jsfromhell.com)

	for(`var j, x, i = array.length; i; j = parseInt(Math.random() * i), x = array[--i], array[i] = array[j], array[j] = x`){
        
       
    }
	return array; 
}
console.log(shuffle(['Kevin', 'van', 'Zonneveld']));


if loop doesn't return any value can I initialize all elements out side for? like below.`var j, x, i = array.length; 
var j = parseInt(Math.random() * i), x = array[--i], array[i] = array[j];
array[j] = x;`

Thanks in advance for attention!

"<p>I had a react native project that was building and running perfectly fine. Then I decided to move it into a sub directory, and I started receiving lots of precompiled header errors: </p>

"<p>I use a TextInputLayout, I would want to programmatically set the hint text color and the floating label color if the input field is mandatory. Before moving to TextInputLayout I used to set the hint text color programmatically  using the following</p>

<p><code>textField.setHintTextColor(Color.RED);</code></p>

<p>Can someone guide me on how to set the hint text color and the floating label color programmatically for a TextInputLayout.</p>

<p>In the screenshot attached i would want the hint text <strong>Address 1</strong> to be in red when not focused and the on focus the floating label <strong>Address 1</strong> should be in red.</p>

<p>For example, suppose <code>x</code> can be <code>""avg""</code> or <code>""median""</code>, <code>y</code> can be <code>""male""</code> or <code>""female""</code>, and <code>z</code> can be <code>""height""</code> or <code>""weight""</code>. How can we concisely get all 8 combinations of the three?</p>

<p>Using <code>rep</code> is a pain:</p>

<pre><code>x &lt;- c(""avg"", ""median"")
y &lt;- c(""male"", ""female"")
z &lt;- c(""height"", ""weight"")

      rep(rep(y, each = length(z)), length(x)),
      rep(z, length(x) * length(y)), sep = ""_"")

"<p>The latest version of the Android Support Library (23.2) adds support for vector drawables. It appears to do this by rasterizing the vectors on the fly on platforms that don't natively support vector drawables.</p>

<p>However, the rasterize image seems to be a fixed size rather that dependent on usage. Here's an example.</p>

<p><strong>Vector</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;vector xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
        android:width=""24dp""
        android:height=""24dp""
        android:viewportWidth=""24.0""
        android:viewportHeight=""24.0""&gt;
    &lt;path
        android:fillColor=""#FF000000""
        android:pathData=""M12,2C6.48,2 2,6.48 2,12s4.48,10 10,10 10,-4.48 10,-10S17.52,2 12,2zm0,3c1.66,0 3,1.34 3,3s-1.34,3 -3,3 -3,-1.34 -3,-3 1.34,-3 3,-3zm0,14.2c-2.5,0 -4.71,-1.28 -6,-3.22 0.03,-1.99 4,-3.08 6,-3.08 1.99,0 5.97,1.09 6,3.08 -1.29,1.94 -3.5,3.22 -6,3.22z""/&gt;
&lt;/vector&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Layout</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;ImageView
  android:layout_width=""128dp""
  android:layout_height=""128dp""
  android:id=""@+id/imageView""
  app:srcCompat=""@drawable/vector1""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The vector is 24dp x 24dp. It's used in an ImageView that's 128dp x 128dp. On platforms that's don't support vector drawables, the resulting image is blurry because the vector is rasterized at 16dp and resized to 128dp.</p>

<p>The only solution I've found is to create a separate vector drawable for each intended size. It's pretty annoying to create a bunch of duplicate vectors with only the height and width changes. And that doesn't solve the problem if you want the drawable to fill_parent or be dynamically sized in some other way.</p>

<p>Having to define the dimensions of your vector images in advanced <em>almost</em> completely defeats the benefit of using vectors in the first place.</p>

<p>Does anyone have a true work around?</p>

<p>USE CASE: We are creating React components in a library for our developers to reuse. Can we design this in an Object Oriented fashion?

"<p>I've got an iterator with some objects in it and I wanted to create a collection of uniqueUsers in which I only list every user once. So playing around a bit I tried it with both a list and a dict:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; for m in ms: print m.to_user  # let's first look what's inside ms
...
Pete Kramer
Pete Kramer
Pete Kramer
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; uniqueUsers = []  # Create an empty list
&gt;&gt;&gt; for m in ms:
...     if m.to_user not in uniqueUsers:
...         uniqueUsers.append(m.to_user)
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; uniqueUsers
[Pete Kramer]  # This is what I would expect
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; uniqueUsers = {}  # Now let's create a dict
&gt;&gt;&gt; for m in ms:
...     if m.to_user not in uniqueUsers:
...         uniqueUsers[m.to_user] = 1
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; uniqueUsers
{Pete Kramer: 1, Pete Kramer: 1, Pete Kramer: 1}
</code></pre>

<p>So I tested it by converting the dict to a list when doing the if statement, and that works as I would expect it to:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; uniqueUsers = {}
&gt;&gt;&gt; for m in ms:
...     if m.to_user not in list(uniqueUsers):
...         uniqueUsers[m.to_user] = 1
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; uniqueUsers
{Pete Kramer: 1}

<p>and I can get a similar result by testing against <code>uniqueUsers.keys()</code>. </p>

<p>The thing is that I don't understand why this difference occurs. I always thought that if you do <code>if object in dict</code>, it simply creates a list of the dicts keys and tests agains that, but that's obviously not the case.</p>

"<p>I started using angular2 (with an express.js backend) with the intention of passing control of several sections of a page to angular2 components, but I eventually realized that the system is much  more effective when angular2 controls an entire area of a page. However, my application is not a SPA and there are other server-rendered routes aside from the route that holds the selector of my angular2 root component. </p>

<p>I have 2 questions, followed by code snippets:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Whenever I load a server-controlled route whose server-side rendered template does not contain the selector of my root component, <code>&lt;main-comp&gt;&lt;/main-comp&gt;</code>, angular2 basically pukes into the console saying it doesn't have anywhere to initialize. I put all of my angular2 initialization code in a shared header for my whole application. Is there a way to tell the angular2 root component not to render itself if its selector simply does not exist on the page?</p></li>
<li><p>The server side route that renders the angular2 root component is <code>/writing</code> and the angular2 routing URL for a particular blog post would be something like <code>/writing/2016/03/post</code>. However, whenever I browse straight to the URL, System.js tries to load app/boot relative to that location, i.e., <code>/writing/2016/03/app/boot</code>, which obviously fails with a 404. I think this is happening because my server controls the <code>/writing</code> route and angular loads relative to the base URL being requested to the server. Thus, the only solution I know of would be to turn my application into an SPA with a single server route being <code>'/'</code>, which would require lots of rewriting to the front end. How can I get around this issue?</p></li>

"<p>I recently became aware of the odd behavior of <code>Uri.ToString()</code> (namely, it unencodes some characters and therefore is primarily suitable for display purposes).

"I'm writing a program that will take an 8 digit number as input by the user and will evaluate it so if any digit that appears more than 3 times will be labelled as ""unacceptable"", if any digit appears 3 or fewer times it is labelled as ""acceptable"".
So numbers:

41124535, 13134113, 24255411

would be labelled as acceptable, but numbers:

34233332, 31111412, 55551122

would be labelled as unacceptable.

My approach is if... else chains and nests. So far I've managed to make a chain work, but it can only compare the digits when they repeat up to 2 times. Then I have a nest, but it only works if I write the else part every step of the way, instead of just leaving one single else at the end. This is crucial since the else part in the end will take the algorithm to a new if else nest that will evaluate the rest of the 8 digit long number.

the beggining of the program:


    cout << ""\n\n\t Input 1st digit:"";
    cin >> A;
    cout << ""\t Input 2nd digit:"";
    cin >> B;
    cout << ""\t Input 3rd digit:"";
    cin >> C;
    cout << ""\t Input 4th digit:"";
    cin >> D;
    cout << ""\t Input 5th digit:"";
    cin >> E;
    cout << ""\t Input 6th digit:"";
    cin >> F;
    cout << ""\t Input 7th digit:"";
    cin >> G;
    cout << ""\t Input 8th digit:"";
    cin >> H;
    
    cout << ""\n\t The number is: ["";
    cout << A;
    cout << B;
    cout << C;
    cout << D;
    cout << E;
    cout << F;
    cout << G;
    cout << H;
    cout << ""]"";

the if else chain:

    if (A==B)
    cout << "" Inaceptable!"";
    else
    if (B==C)
    cout << "" Inaceptable!"";
    else
    if (C==D)
    cout << "" Inaceptable!"";
    else
    if (D==E)
    cout << "" Inaceptable!"";
    else
    if (E==F)
    cout << "" Inaceptable!"";
    else
    if (F==G)
    cout << "" Inaceptable!"";
    else
    if (G==H)
    cout << "" Inaceptable!"";
    else
    cout << "" Aceptable"";


then the nest with several else commands:

    if (A==B)
    {
    if (A==C)
    {
    if (A==D)
    cout << "" Unacceptable!"";
    else
    cout << "" Acceptable"";
    }
    else
    cout << "" Acceptable"";
    }
    else
    cout << "" Acceptable"";

so my guess is an if else chain with if else nests for each variable, but I can't work it out",LQ

"<p>I'm trying to wrap my head around how to change deeply-nested state in redux. It makes sense to me to combine reducers and change first-level properties of the state for those pieces. Where I'm not so clear is on how to change the state of a deeply-nested property.
Let's pretend that I have a shopping cart app. Below is my state:    </p>

<pre><code>{
    cart: {
      items: []
    },
    account: {
      amountLeft: 100,
      discounts: {
        redeemed: [],
        coupons: {
          buyOneGetOne: false
        }
      }
    }  
}
</code></pre>

<p>When a user enters in a code, let's say they can redeem the ""buyOneGetOne"" coupon and that value should become true. 
I have a reducer for cart and another for account. For a first-level property (like if I was clearing the cart's items), I would just do the following in my reducer:</p>

<pre><code>case 'EMPTY_CART':
  return Object.assign({}, state, {items: []});
</code></pre>

<p>For changing buyOneGetOne, however, it seems like I would first need to do an Object.assign on coupons (because buyOneGetOne was modified), then doing an Object.assign on discounts (because I had modified coupons), and then finally emitting the action so the reducer could do Object.assign on the account (because discounts has now changed). This seems really complicated and easy to do wrong, though, which leads me to believe there must be a better way.</p>

<p>Am I going about this all wrong? It seems like reducers are only used to modify the root level properties of the state (like cart and account) and that I shouldn't have a reducer that touches state inside the account (like a discounts reducer), because account already has a reducer. But when I only want to change one property far down the state tree, it gets complex to merge every object from that change all the way up the object chain to the child of the root...</p>

<p>Can you/should you have reducers inside of reducers, like in this case have a discounts reducer?</p>

"<p>A RecyclerView is different from a ListView because it doesn't offer an onItemCLickListener class to handle click events.</p>

<p>This can be tackled if not a lot is happening behind the scenes when an item is clicked, by defining an onClickListener in the ViewHolder.</p>

<p>What if the text or whatever that has to be passed to the next Activity doesnt really exist in the views that the ViewHolder has access to, but is rather a part of the Activity which has the RecyclerView?</p>

<p>In that case, the onClickListener must be implemented inside the activity so that the text can be forwarded. It is possible.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>One way is to add an Invisible View holding that text, and then doing what has been done before; implementing onClickListener in the Adapter.  </p></li>

"<p>I've been working through <a href=""http://blog.madewithlove.be/post/webpack-your-bags/"">Webpack tutorial</a>. In one of the sections, it gives the code example that contains one line of essence to this question:</p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>export default class Button { /* class code here */ }
</code></pre>

<p>In the next section of said tutorial, titled ""Code splitting"", the class defined above is loaded on demand, like this:</p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>require.ensure([], () =&gt; {
    const Button = require(""./Components/Button"");
    const button = new Button(""google.com"");
    // ...
});
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, this code throws an exception:</p>

<pre><code>Uncaught TypeError: Button is not a function
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I know that the <em>right</em> way to include ES6 module would be to simply <code>import Button from './Components/Button';</code> at the top of the file, but using a construct like that anywhere else in the file makes babel a sad panda:</p>

<pre><code>SyntaxError: index.js: 'import' and 'export' may only appear at the top level
</code></pre>

<p>After some fiddling with previous (<code>require.ensure()</code>) example above, I realized that ES6 <code>export default</code> syntax exports an object that has property named <code>default</code>, which contains my code (the <code>Button</code> function).</p>

<p>I did fix the broken code example by appending <code>.default</code> after require call, like this:</p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>const Button = require(""./Components/Button"").default;
</code></pre>

<p>...but I think it looks a bit clumsy and it is error-prone (I'd have to know which module uses ES6 syntax, and which uses good old <code>module.exports</code>).</p>

<p>Which brings me to my question: <strong>what is the right way to import ES6 code from code that uses CommonJS syntax?</strong></p>

"ive ran across a topic that discusses how you could create an app that allows you to send an sms to the application and receive them from it. My question is simply the following:

Can someone send an sms to that app regardless of where they live or are there any limitations in terms of service provider etc?

"First off all im a new member to this community and i have been browsing allot on this website to get answers on my questions. Ran into this problem that i can't figure out so im asking it my self. 

Question:

Im coding this telegram bot for my clan and was searching for a way so that the bot will send a reply based on few words in the text msg. So lets say I type a  text in the group containing the words ""Thalia"" and ""love"" the bot will respond. (tried it in different ways but this is the only way i got it to work)

    elif ""thalia"" in text.lower():
            if ""love"" in text.lower():
                reply(""I love u too babe <3."" ""\nBut I love my maker even more ;)."")
            else:
                reply(""Say my name Bitch!"")
This code works:
[msg containing thalia and love][1]

The reason why i coded it like this is because everytime i use the ""and"" ""or"" command the statement doesn't work and the bot goes crazy. Like if i coded: `elif ""thalia"" and ""love"".....` it wouldn't work.

If there is another way to code this i would appreciate the tip!

Now im trying the same technique on more words with the ""and"" and ""or"" commands but it doesn't work. if i leave ""and"" and ""or"" out it works fine. But of course then i cant use the combinations  of words i want with this particular response.

     elif ""what"" or ""when"" in text.lower():
            if ""time"" or ""do"" in text.lower():
                if ""match"" in text.lower():
                    reply (""If you need assicante with matches type or press /matches"")



[it triggered the command without the 3 words in one sentence][2]

*so how can i rewrite this code in a more ""professional"" way and what do i need to change to get it to work. So that the bot responds only when the combination of the words are used like in the thalia love code. Instead of when ""matches"" is used.*

"I need to append the phrase `bar` to the character (occurring at the end of the subject line) `o`, but iff said line does NOT start with whitespace AND is followed, *two lines down*, by a line that DOES start with whitespace.

FYI, in my input file (an ASCII text file), all blank lines are truly empty lines, with no whitespace in them whatsoever.  There are no double-spaced lines in said input file.  All non-empty lines that do NOT start with whitespace are preceded by empty lines.  I'm not concerned about any last line/second-to-last line edge cases.  Finally, the solution must be able to be inserted into a BASH command line pipeline I've set up to process my rather ugly, 80's era DOS text input files.

Suppose I have the following file:

    foo
    
    third line foo
        
    fifth line foo
     this line starts with a space foo
     this line starts with a space foo
        
    ninth line foo
        
    eleventh line foo
        
     this line starts with a space foo
    
    last line foo

I want the output to look like this:

    foobar
    
    third line foobar
    
    fifth line foo
     this line starts with a space foo
     this line starts with a space foo
    
    ninth line foobar
    
    eleventh line foo
    
     this line starts with a space foo
    
    last line foo

Although I'm looking for a sed solution, awk and perl are welcome as well.  All solutions must be able to be used in a pipeline (as I mentioned above).  Also welcomed are solutions which handle a more general case (e.g. able to append the desired text to lines that end in various ways, including whitespace).

Now, for the backstory:

I recently asked a question similar to the subject question a few days ago (see [here][1]).  As you can see, I got some great answers.  It turned out, however, that I did not fully understand my problem, so I did not ask the correct question that would actually solve said problem.

Now, I'm asking the right question!

"<p>I am somewhat confused over how Go handles non blocking IO.
API's mostly look synchronous to me, and when watching presentations on Go, its not uncommon to hear comments like ""and the call blocks""</p>

<p>Is Go using blocking IO when reading from files or network?
Or is there some kind of magic that re-writes the code when used from inside a Go Routine?</p>

<p>Coming from a C# background, this feels very non intuitive, in C# we have the <code>await</code> keyword when consuming async API's.
Which clearly communicates that the API can yield the current thread and continue later inside a continuation.</p>

<p>So TLDR;
Will Go block the current thread when doing IO inside a Go routine, or will it be transformed into a C# like async await state machine using continuations?</p>

"<p>So, I've been having this problem for a little while now. Frequently when I just try to open any of my projects I get the following error:</p>

<pre><code>---------------------------
Microsoft Visual Studio
---------------------------
The 'Visual C++ Project System Package' package did not load correctly.



The problem may have been caused by a configuration change or by the
installation of another extension. You can get more information by examining the
file 'C:\Users\Q009\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\VisualStudio\14.0\ActivityLog.xml'.



Restarting Visual Studio could help resolve this issue.



Continue to show this error message?

<p>Opening the activity log reveals the following error:</p>

<p>In order to 'solve' this I just go to AppData/Local/Microsoft and remove VisualStudio and VSCommon folders. This fixes it for a while allowing me to continue work on my projects. Until the issue randomly decides to come back again.</p>

<p>Again, to clarify the situation. It's not a migration problem or a problem with newly installed packages. I've had this setup for a while now and those projects were created using this very instance of Visual Studio.</p>

"<p>In the last couple of weeks we've been investigating some performance issues where our MVC application was responding very slow for the first request. We are talking like 30-45 seconds for the first request and 3 seconds for each new view. Our MVC application is using our OData API (Web API) which is located on the same server. Besides the same performance issues as the MVC application, the first query to entity framework version 6 is executing in 6 seconds and new queries is executing 200ms slower than subsequent queries.</p>

<p>In order to meet our requirements, we have chosen to execute all known Ef queries and hit all our MVC/API endpoints from Application_Start in Global.asax. This seems to work fine for at least a couple of hours, but after some time without use, the first request to every MVC view is responding in 3-5 seconds.</p>

<p>We have configured the websites to be ""Always on"" and we have not found anything in the IIS logs or the logging we've added to Application_Start. So it seems our applications are at least not recycling. I suspect some kind of IIS cache being cleared or maybe some Ef cache? Any suggestions are welcome.</p>

"<p>I'm curious about what is the suggested way to define member functions in Kotlin. Consider these two member functions:</p>

<pre><code>class A {

  fun f(x: Int) = 42

  val g = fun(x: Int) = 42

}
</code></pre>

<p>These appear to accomplish the same thing, but I found subtle differences.</p>

<p>The <code>val</code> based definition, for instance, seems to be more flexible in some scenarios. That is, I could not work out a straight forward way to compose <code>f</code> with other functions, but I could with <code>g</code>. To toy around with these definitions, I used the <a href=""https://github.com/MarioAriasC/funKTionale"">funKTionale</a> library. I found that this does not compile:</p>

<pre><code>val z = g andThen A::f // f is a member function
</code></pre>

<p>But if <code>f</code> were defined as a <code>val</code> pointing to the same function, it would compile just fine. To figure out what was going on I asked IntelliJ to explicitly define the type of <code>::f</code> and <code>g</code> for me, and it gives me this:</p>

<pre><code>val fref: KFunction1&lt;Int, Int&gt; = ::f

val gref: (Int) -&gt; Int = g
</code></pre>

<p>So one is of type <code>KFunction1&lt;Int, Int&gt;</code>, the other is of type <code>(Int) -&gt; Int</code>. It's easy to see that both represent functions of type <code>Int -&gt; Int</code>.</p>

<p>What is the difference between these two types, and in which cases does it matter? I noticed that for top-level functions, I can compose them fine using either definition, but in order to make the aforementioned composition compile, I had to write it like so:</p>

<pre><code>val z = g andThen A::f.partially1(this)
</code></pre>

<p>i.e. I had to partially apply it to <code>this</code> first.</p>

<p>Since I don't have to go through this hassle when using <code>val</code>s for functions, is there a reason why I should ever define non-Unit member functions using <code>fun</code>? Is there a difference in performance or semantics that I am missing?</p>

"<p>I would like to have properties, that I can reference via @Value in spring beans, that can only be created dependend on other properties.
In particular I am having a property, that describes the file system location of a directory.</p>

<pre><code>myDir=/path/to/mydir
</code></pre>

<p>And by convention, there is a file in that directory, that is always called <em>myfile.txt</em>.</p>

<p>Now i want to have access to both, the directory and the file, via @Value annotations inside my beans. And sometimes I want to access them as Strings, sometimes as java.io.Files and sometimes as org.springframework.core.io.FileSystemResource (which by the way works very well out of the box!). But because of that concatenating Strings on demand is not an option.</p>

<p>So what I of course could do is just declare both, but I would end up with</p>

myFile/path/to/mydir/myfile.txt

    props.put(""myFile, absoluteFilePath.toString());
    environment.getPropertySources().addFirst(new MapPropertySource(""additional"", props));

<p>For Noda Time 2.0, I've moved everything over to DNX/DNU (soon to be dotnet cli, of course). However, we now want to build a regularly-updated package containing the latest time zone information from <a href=""https://www.iana.org/time-zones"">IANA</a>. We'll build one version of that with a dependency on Noda Time 1.3.1, and another version with a dependency on Noda Time 2.0.0.</p>

<p>I would <em>like</em> to do all of this still within DNX/DNU, but it's unclear to me whether there's any way of telling DNX/DNU about this target framework. Note that I want to make this available to all current users of 1.3.1, and it also depends on 1.3.1, so I believe the set of target frameworks basically needs to be identical.</p>

<p>I've tried frameworks of:</p>

<ul>
<li>portable-net40+sl5+win8+wpa81+wp8 (which I expected to have the best chance of working based on the <a href=""https://docs.nuget.org/create/targetframeworks"">Nuget documentation</a>)</li>
<li>portable-net4+sl5+netcore45+wpa81+wp8+MonoAndroid1+MonoTouch1+XamariniOS1</li>
<li>Profile328 </li>
</ul>

<p>In every case, <code>dnu restore</code> shows an error of this form:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""portable-net40+sl5+win8+wpa81+wp8"" is an unsupported framework.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have a horrible suspicion that this basically isn't a supported use case, and that I'll need to stick to a regular csproj file for this particular part, but I thought it worth asking to see if I'm missing something.</p>

"<p>Some time ago I had trouble with the npm cache on our build machines. From time to time we had to do <code>npm cache clean</code> by hand, and that solved various issues that we are still not certain about what caused them. So after a time we included <code>npm cache clean</code> in all our build scripts, since then we did not have mysterious problems with <code>npm i</code>, however now parallel builds obviously affect each other.</p>

"<p>Using PyCharm, I have configured a virtual environment. This results in some really confusing interactions with PATH. When I look at the environment variable for PATH that a file has:</p>

<p>I see the following output:</p>

<pre><code>##### PATH
 /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Users/username/.virtualenvs/venv/bin

<p>This confuses me because I have explicitly told PyCharm to use system environment variables through the following dialog:</p>

<pre><code>##### PATH
/Users/username/.virtualenvs/username/bin:/Users/username/go/dependencies/bin:/usr/local/go/bin:/usr/local/go/bin:/usr/local/bin:.... etc

<p>This is without any other configuration taking place in PyCharm - simply relaunching it from a shell causes PATH to behave set differently</p></li>
<li><p>I can also manually define the PATH variable in PyCharm (to the value given in the parent environment variables tab) and it works fine, too</p></li>
</ol>

<p>But for some reason PyCharm is not pulling the PATH variable from my parent environment variables even though it is present and <em>appears</em> to be included properly (without either of the above two workarounds).</p>

"<p>I'm creating an app that generates live instrument sounds and I'm planning on using the new Midi API featured in Android Marshmallow (version 6.0). I've read the package overview document here <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/midi/package-summary.html"">http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/midi/package-summary.html</a> and I know how to generate Midi notes but i'm still unsure: how do I actually play these notes after I've generated their Midi data?</p>

<p>Do I need a synthesizer program to play Midi notes? If so, do I have to make my own or is one provided by Android or a 3rd party?</p>

<p>I am a novice with Midi so please be as descriptive as possible with your answer. </p>

<p><strong>What i've tried so far:</strong> 
I've created a Midi manager object and opened an input port</p>

<pre><code>MidiManager m = (MidiManager)context.getSystemService(Context.MIDI_SERVICE); 
MidiInputPort inputPort = device.openInputPort(index);
</code></pre>

<p>Then, i've sent a test noteOn midi message to the port </p>

<pre><code>byte[] buffer = new byte[32];
int numBytes = 0;
int channel = 3; // MIDI channels 1-16 are encoded as 0-15.
buffer[numBytes++] = (byte)(0x90 + (channel - 1)); // note on
buffer[numBytes++] = (byte)60; // pitch is middle C
buffer[numBytes++] = (byte)127; // max velocity
int offset = 0;
// post is non-blocking
inputPort.send(buffer, offset, numBytes);
</code></pre>

<p>I've also set up a class to receive the midi note messages </p>

<pre><code>class MyReceiver extends MidiReceiver {
    public void onSend(byte[] data, int offset,
            int count, long timestamp) throws IOException {
        // parse MIDI or whatever
    }
}
MidiOutputPort outputPort = device.openOutputPort(index);
outputPort.connect(new MyReceiver());
</code></pre>

<p>Now, here's where i'm most confused. The use case of my app is to be an all-in-one composition &amp; playback tool for making music. In other words, my app needs to contain or use a virtual midi device (like an intent of another app's midi synthesizer). Unless someone already made such a synthesizer, I must create one myself within my app's lifecycle. How do I actually actually convert a received midi noteOn() into sound coming out of my speakers? I'm especially confused because there also has to be a way to programmatically decide what type of instrument the note sounds like it's coming from: is this also done in a synthesizer?</p>

<p>Midi support in Android Marshmallow is fairly new so I haven't been able to find any tutorials or sample synthesizer apps online. Any insight is appreciated.</p>

"<p>When you want code works under race conditions, commonly developers uses <strong>Optimistic concurrency control</strong> (OCC). From Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...before committing, each transaction verifies that no other
  transaction has modified the data it has read. If the check reveals
  conflicting modifications, the committing transaction rolls back...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An approach to implement OCC is checking a <code>version</code> of the data to be modified. If the version differs, then other transactions have modified the data and the it's up to the application to decide how it should resolve the conflict (reattempt, notify user...). </p>

<p>A draft would be as following:</p>

<pre><code>class Repository
{
    public class save($data)
    {
        $currentVersion = $data-&gt;version;
        $data-&gt;version  = $currentVersion + 1;

        $result = $this-&gt;db-&gt;update($data, [
            'id'        =&gt; $data-&gt;id,
            'version'   =&gt; $currentVersion
        ]);

        if (1 === $result) {
            // everything ok
        } else {
            // conflict!
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>My question is, as in <code>EventSourcing</code> we only <strong>append</strong> all events that occurs in the domain, we can't no longer use this approach to implement OCC. Which are other approaches to keep OOC while using EventSourcing?</p>

<p>An option that could works, it's lookup for conflicting events when store them. This approach allow a fine grained control over the events. I don't know if this will over complicated the solution or it's a ""standard"" that I think is pointed out at <a href=""http://danielwhittaker.me/2014/09/29/handling-concurrency-issues-cqrs-event-sourced-system/"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://danielwhittaker.me/2014/09/29/handling-concurrency-issues-cqrs-event-sourced-system/</a></p>

"<p>Since upgrading to VS 2015, my team has experienced random quirky things which I'm sure are being worked out at Microsoft right now.  One pretty annoying one is that we seem to lose project references, especially after branching.  I began to work on a new branch of our solution yesterday only to find out that types were unrecognized and namespace usings were being cited as unnecessary (because they were for the types that had suddenly become unrecognized).</p>

<p>The references in the project did not show any icons indicating a problem with the reference, but just to see if it would work, I removed and re-added a project reference, which caused its types to be recognized once more.</p>

<p>This, of course, updated the project file, so I looked to see what changes had been made.  The only difference between the project that could not detect the reference and the one that now can is that the alpha characters in the GUID had been changed from lower case to upper case.  For example:</p>

<p>Old, broken reference:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ProjectReference Include=""path/redacted""&gt;
    &lt;Project&gt;{95d34b2e-2ceb-499e-ab9e-b644b0af710d}&lt;/Project&gt;

    &lt;Name&gt;Project.Name.Redacted&lt;/Name&gt;
&lt;/ProjectReference&gt;

<p>I'm looking for the reason this is happening and how I might fix it without having to manually remove and re-add references all over the place (and without having to convert all the project file GUIDs to upper case).</p>

<p>I should note that these ""broken"" references are not breaking the build, and that they only show up in the Error List as IntelliSense error, not build errors.  So, the references aren't really broken, they've just broken IntelliSense (which is arguably worse?!).</p>

"<p>I'm currently trying to use Seaborn to create plots for my academic papers. The plots look great and easy to generate, but one problem that I'm having some trouble with is having the fine control on the font size in the plots. </p>

<p>My font size in my paper is 9pt and I would like to make sure the font size in my plots are either 9pt or 10pt. But in seaborn, the font size is mainly controlled through font scale <code>sns.set_context(""paper"", font_scale=0.9)</code>. So it's hard for me to find the right font size except through trial and error. Is there a more efficient way to do this?</p>

<p>I also want to make sure the font size is consistent between different seaborn plots. But not all my seaborn plots have the same dimension, so it seems like using the <em>same font_scale</em> on all the plots does not necessarily create the same font size across these different plots?</p>

<p>I've attached my code below. I appreciate any comments on how to format the plot for a two column academic paper. My goal is to be able to control the size of the figure without distorting the font size or the plot. I use Latex to write my paper. </p>

"<p>Ok, it's 2016. <a href=""https://webpack.github.io/"">Webpack</a> looks like a winner against <a href=""http://requirejs.org/"">requirejs</a> and <a href=""http://browserify.org/"">browserify</a>. I've been reading about those 3 technologies, to solve a very specific problem. <strong>I want to avoid this in my HTML file (part of an AngularJS application)</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src=""some-file.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=""some-file2.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=""some-file3.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;!-- Dozens of similar lines here... --&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, <strong>the order of those lines in my HTML file matters</strong>. Bootstrap will ask for jQuery, etc. </p>

<p>First thing I found: requirejs. You just specify something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src=""my-bundled-file.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And then, you solve the dependency problem with JS. Going further, I found 2 approaches here:</p>

<ul>
<li>CommonJS (browserify)</li>
<li>AMD (require.js)</li>
</ul>

<p>Webpack works with both approaches, which sounds nice.</p>

<p>At the end, the 3 tools can be used for the same thing: <strong>bundle several files in only one</strong>. But what I'm worried about is <strong>the order in which those files are bundled</strong>. </p>

<p>I don't want to care about this, and looks like using those solutions (or even gulp + gulp-concat, like is suggested <a href=""https://medium.com/@dickeyxxx/best-practices-for-building-angular-js-apps-266c1a4a6917#.v0t56k8rb"">here</a>), <strong>I'm just moving the problem: now, I specify the modules which my application uses with JS code, but I still need to put the modules in the correct order</strong>, even with WebPack (an example <a href=""http://www.shmck.com/webpack-angular-part-2/"">here</a>: <code>require</code> calls must be in the correct order)</p>

<p>So, my questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>am I misunderstanding these tools? I just want to solve the loading order problem, and looks like I'm not doing it</strong></li>
<li><strong>do these tools solve a different problem (lack of native modules in ES5, which drives to contaminate the global scope)?</strong></li>

"<p>I am learning to use react.js and have some issues to use the event handlers. The final question would be: Is it possible to use server side rendering and send event handlers to the client automaticly?</p>

<p>Here is my example:
I have an index.jsx which I render server side and send to the client</p>

<pre><code>var React = require(""react"");
var DefaultLayout = require(""./layout/default"");

var LikeButton = React.createClass({
  getInitialState: function() {
    return {liked: false}; 
  }, 
  handleClick: function(event) {
    this.setState({liked: !this.state.liked});
  }, 
  render: function() {
    var text = this.state.liked ? 'like' : 'haven\'t liked';
    return (
      &lt;p onClick={this.handleClick}&gt;
        You {text} this. Click to toggle.
      &lt;/p&gt;
    );
  } 
});

var IndexComponent = React.createClass({
   render: function(){
       return (
           &lt;DefaultLayout title={this.props.name}&gt;
                &lt;div&gt;
                        &lt;h1&gt;React Test&lt;/h1&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;div id=""testButton""&gt;
                    &lt;LikeButton/&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt; 

                &lt;script type=""text/babel"" src=""/js/react.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
           &lt;/DefaultLayout&gt;
       )
   }   
});
</code></pre>

<p>But the ""Like Button"" does not have any interaction. To make it do something on click I have to add this code client side.</p>

<pre><code>var LikeButton = React.createClass({
  getInitialState: function() {
    return {liked: false};
  },
  handleClick: function(event) {
    this.setState({liked: !this.state.liked});
  },
  render: function() {
    var text = this.state.liked ? 'like' : 'haven\'t liked';
    return (
      &lt;p onClick={this.handleClick}&gt;
        You {text} this. Click to toggle.
      &lt;/p&gt;
    );
  }
});

ReactDOM.render(
  &lt;LikeButton /&gt;,
  document.getElementById('testButton')
);
</code></pre>

<p>I only started out with react.js and maybe I am just missing some major concept here. But why does react.js not just create the code (which I now have to add manually to the client) when rendering the page server side?
Like this, I have redundant code and it feels like this will be a mess in larger applications. 
At least react.js is smart enough to not draw two LikeButtons but to ""bind"" the one created server side to the client side component. </p>

"<p>We just finished building an electron application with node and react. The application is running smooth on every platform and we are pretty happy of the result. 
Now we received the request  to distribute a version of that app on dvd (meaning that we need to run the application directly from the disc without installing it on the local drive) so we just burn it and tried to launch it.
The app is working fine but the problem is the loading time as it takes almost 2 minutes to have the app running without any feedback to the end user.
This is caused by the overhead for loading a large number of files which is very slow from the optical drive.
So we need some ideas to speed up things or at least to have something to show to the user during the loading time. 
This could be a launcher application with a splash screen but it must run on mac, win and linux.
We thought at QT, but we'd like something less complicated..</p>

    transclude: {
      'heading': 'heading',

<p>As you see, my news directive has two children, called heading and content fields. It can be used as follows:</p>

"I notice your quite an expert with Apache Cordova/Phone Gap. I seek your advise and would also like to compensate you for your time. I am attempting to build an application for displaying my inventory online. Part of that requires to print a label and apply it to my inventory. The application itself works fine. The Problem is with the Printer i have chosen. I have purchased a iMZ320 Zebra printer. I need the plugin to have it work on my current application this has proven to be beyond the skill set of my team.

https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-zbtprinter

I noticed your plugin can it be modified to work on both IOS and Android applications.

We are not using a desktop app, we only developed on android and iOS
Our target devices are Android 4/5/6 and iOS 7/8/9
We use the CLI to initialize project code, then switch to eclipse to continue development.

"<p>I'm having a problem left-aligning a <code>UIButton</code>'s text. I also tried changing it to <code>.Right</code> but it still stays centered.

"<p><strong>My problem:</strong>
The ionic app I'm developing is horribly slow, after finding out UIWebView is the culprit I'm looking for ways to speed it up, with WKWebView being the most promising solution. </p>

<p><strong>What my project looks like:</strong>
When setting up a sample ionic project (<a href=""http://ccoenraets.github.io/ionic-tutorial/install-ionic.html"">http://ccoenraets.github.io/ionic-tutorial/install-ionic.html</a> for example) with the current Cordova 4.1.0 CLI (i'm using Ionic 1.2.4) UIWebView is used as default. However, since Cordova 4, the new and faster WKWebView is supported out-of-the-box and can be forced, at least in iOS 9 (<a href=""https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine"">cordova 4 supports WKWebView</a>).</p>

<p><strong>The plugin I used &amp; configured:</strong>
via <code>cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine</code> the support is added for the iOS platform (9.3 right now). When this plugin is added and properly configured in the config.xml with</p>

<p><code>&lt;feature name=""CDVWKWebViewEngine""&gt;
    &lt;param name=""ios-package"" value=""CDVWKWebViewEngine"" /&gt;
 &lt;/feature&gt;
 &lt;preference name=""CordovaWebViewEngine"" value=""CDVWKWebViewEngine"" /&gt;</code></p>

<p><strong>What I tried so far:</strong>
In the terminal <code>ionic build ios</code>, then build succeeds, and when installing the app via XCode 7.3 on OS X El Capitan 10.11.3 in the console log the <code>Using WKWebView</code> message is printed but then, right after the splashscreen, the app container fades into a white screen of death. As soon as I remove that plugin, UIWebView is used and the app works as expected.</p>

<p><em>Alternative</em>: replacing the original plugin <a href=""https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugins/tree/master/wkwebview-engine-localhost"">wkwebview-engine-localhost</a> with one with integrated localhost, works. As I understood, the WKWebview should be supported by cordova and ionic right out of the box, without having to rely on some ""labs plugin"" with an integrated server, which was developed to support iOS 8 which I don't need. I understand that WKWebView has quite some limitations compared to the old UIWebView, especially when it comes to handling <code>file://</code> statements <a href=""https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-10967?jql=project%20%3D%20CB%20AND%20labels%20%3D%20wkwebview-known-issues"">known issues</a>, but there for sure must be someone out there who got Ionic + Cordova WKWebView working without all the hassle I had, right? There must be better ways to achieving a simple speed improvement for the webview.</p>

<p>I tried probably every solution, config, plugin combination, cordova cli version downgrade (minimum being 4.0.0 for WKWebView support), clearing caches and resetting and restarting of my device, new install and readding of platforms and update of cordova, npm, various plugins, but all of them either didn't help at all except for the apache labs plugin above or seemed like a huge mess that didn't change anything.</p>

<p>When remote debugging the ios app on the device via my local Safari, I can see in the elements tree, that the body tag stays either empty, or a simple ""ng-view"" placeholder for an angular element is shown. Am I correct that there must be a problem with the retrieval of files/angular scripts through the way cordova via WKWwebView handles it?</p>

<p>Note: the app itself works fine, either with <code>ionic serve</code> or <code>ionic emulate ios</code>, only when deploying to a real device over XCode (since <code>ionic run ios</code> doesn't work, but that's a different story) the white screen appears.</p>

<p>Any help is very much appreciated, as it seems to me I have to either use the localhost+wkwebview plugin or let the users suffer from poor speed.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot!</p>

Thanks!",LQ
"i am fairly new in angular and still learning. i posted a question regarding how to pass scope data to directives. two nice people answer my question but explanation was very small. so i do not understand few area in code of two answer. here i will post the two set of answer and code here and if possible some one answer my points.

basically i am looking for guidance to understand the 2 set of code below.

1st set of Code
----------------

    <li my-directive price=""item.price"" ng-repeat=""item in products"">{{item.name}} &mdash; {{item.price}}</li>
    
    myApp.directive('myDirective', function(){
      return {
        scope: { price: '=' },
        require: 'ngModel',
        link : function(scope){
          console.log(scope.price)
        },
        controller: function(scope, element, attrs, ngModel){
          console.log(ngModel.price);
          console.log(scope.price);
        }
      }
    });

point 1
----------
why **scope declared in directive** ? isolated scope **property name has to be price** ? here can we give different name ?

point 2
----------
i am new in ng. this is first time i notice **controller declared in directive**. why and when people declare controller in directive ? mostly we declare controller out side of directive. controller function and controller inside in directive both are same or different?

point 3
----------
what is meaning of `require: 'ngModel', ?` if we do not write require: `ngModel then what will not work? 

2nd set of Code
----------------

    angular.module('myApp')
    .directive('myDirective', function () {
        return {
            transclude: true,
            restrict: 'AEC',
            scope: {
                name: '=',
                price: '='
            },
            templateUrl: 'my-directive.html',
            link: function (scope, element, attr) {
                }
            }
        }
    });
    
    <li my-directive ng-repeat=""item in products"" price=""item.price"" name = ""item.name""></li>

points 1
----------
what is `transclude: true ?` what is the meaning of `transclude = true or false?` in what kind of situation people work with `transclude: true or false?`

points 2
----------
where i have to put the **file my-directive.html** in folder. what would be the location of the file?

angular will load this template file **automatically**?",LQ

"I am trying to make an ""Add to Cart"" in Swift Xcode for a retail store. My current issue is that I am trying to pass a 'label' which carries database information from one view controller to another. The issue is that the label carries information. Most tutorials discuss how to pass text fields onto another view controller. I need to pass the information to a popover which will act as a shopping cart. 

This is the video I have seen to be most useful however it uses text fields and I need to pass label to label. Or in other words pass that label with the data to the popover.

<p>My team meets weekly with another team, and we like to present them a list of Github pull requests we've merged within the past week.</p>

<p>We can do a search for any items merged since a particular date with the filter:</p>

"<p>On the surface, this appears to be a silly question. Some patience please.. :-)
Am structuring this qs into 2 parts:</p>

<p><strong>Part 1:</strong>
I fully understand that platform RAM is mapped into the kernel segment; esp on 64-bit systems this will work well. So each kernel virtual address is indeed just an offset from physical memory (DRAM).</p>

<p>Also, it's my understanding that as Linux is a modern virtual memory OS, (pretty much) <em>all</em> addresses are treated as virtual addresses and must ""go"" via hardware - the TLB/MMU - at runtime and then get  translated by the TLB/MMU via kernel paging tables. Again, easy to understand for user-mode processes.</p>

<p>HOWEVER, what about kernel virtual addresses? For efficiency, would it not be simpler to direct-map these (and an identity mapping is indeed setup from PAGE_OFFSET onwards). But still, at runtime, the kernel virtual address <strong><em>must</em></strong> go via the TLB/MMU and get translated right??? Is this actually the case? Or is kernel virtual addr translation just an offset calculation?? (But how can that be, as we <em>must</em> go via hardware TLB/MMU?). As a simple example, lets consider:</p>

<pre><code>char *kptr = kmalloc(1024, GFP_KERNEL);
</code></pre>

<p>Now kptr is a kernel virtual address. 
I understand that virt_to_phys() can perform the offset calculation and return the physical DRAM address. 
But, <em>here's the Actual Question</em>: it can't be done in this manner via software - that would be pathetically slow! So, back to my earlier point: it would have to be translated via hardware (TLB/MMU). 
<em>Is this actually the case??</em></p>

<p><strong>Part 2:</strong>
Okay, lets say this is the case, and we do use paging in the kernel to do this, we must of course setup kernel paging tables; I understand it's rooted at swapper_pg_dir.</p>

<p>(I also understand that vmalloc() unlike kmalloc() is a special case- it's  a pure virtual region that gets backed by physical frames only on page fault).</p>

<p>If (in Part 1) we do conclude that kernel virtual address translation is done via kernel paging tables, then how exactly does the kernel paging table (swapper_pg_dir) get ""attached"" or ""mapped"" to a user-mode process?? This should happen in the context-switch code? How? Where?</p>

<p>Eg.
On an x86_64, 2 processes A and B are alive, 1 cpu.
A is running, so it's higher-canonical addr
<code>0xFFFF8000 00000000 through 0xFFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF</code>  ""map"" to the kernel segment, and it's lower-canonical addr
<code>0x0 through 0x00007FFF FFFFFFFF</code>   map to it's private userspace.</p>

<p>Now, if we context-switch A->B, process B's lower-canonical region is unique But
it must ""map"" to the same kernel of course!
How exactly does this happen? How do we ""auto"" refer to the kernel paging table when
in kernel mode? Or is that a wrong statement?</p>

<p>Thanks for your patience, would really appreciate a well thought out answer!</p>

I have attached an image. Have a look at it.

When I first saw that line, it got me to think, in the high level language context if it is indeed:

1) a pointer to a function which does nothing at all, but calls itself, thus achieving recursion instead.

2) an array/structure of x datatype whose first index is a pointer to the array/structure itself OR the structure/array's first entry. **And hence my question in the title**.

"<p>I have carefully read and re-read the Vue docs <a href=""http://vuejs.org/guide/reactivity.html#Change-Detection-Caveats"" rel=""noreferrer"">""Reactivity in Depth""</a> and the API for <a href=""http://vuejs.org/api/#vm-set"" rel=""noreferrer"">vm.$set</a> and <a href=""http://vuejs.org/api/#Vue-set"" rel=""noreferrer"">Vue.set</a> but I am still having a difficult time determining when to use which.  It is important for me to be able to distinguish between the two because in my current Laravel project, we are setting a lot of properties on objects dynamically.  </p>

<p>The distinction in the docs seems to be between the language that vm.$set is ""For Vue instance"" while Vue.set is ""For plain data objects"" and that Vue.set is global:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, there are ways to add a property and make it reactive after
  an instance has been created.</p>
  
  <p>For Vue instances, you can use the $set(path, value) instance method:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>vm.$set('b', 2)
// `vm.b` and `data.b` are now reactive
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>For plain data objects, you can use the global Vue.set(object, key,
  value) method:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>Vue.set(data, 'c', 3)
// `vm.c` and `data.c` are now reactive
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, I was wondering if the 3rd ""option"" of doing the above (which is for adding multiple properties at one time) could be used as an equivalent substitute for either of the 2 options above (by adding just 1 property instead of multiple)?  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sometimes you may want to assign a number of properties on to an
  existing object, for example using Object.assign() or _.extend().
  However, new properties added to the object will not trigger changes.
  In such cases, create a fresh object with properties from both the
  original object and the mixin object:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>// instead of `Object.assign(this.someObject, { a: 1, b: 2 })`
this.someObject = Object.assign({}, this.someObject, { a: 1, b: 2 })
</code></pre>

"I'm running streamreader over a text file and storing the data into an arraylist. The data is separated by "","" and it basically stores appointment dates and times. Some Patients have only been seen twice so I have to add no data into the text file but still add the "","" to insure the streamreader moves over it.

However when it gets to the Patient that only has two visits it stops reading the file and just stores the data up to that point. I have a try catch error handling which tells me when it stops reading the file.

<p>I have a <code>tox.ini</code>:</p>

<p>which runs my Python unittests in several Python versions and works perfectly.</p>

<p>I want to setup a build in Travis-CI to automatically run this when I push changes to Github, so I have a <code>.travis.yml</code>:</p>

-   ""3.3""
-   ""3.4""

install:
-   pip install tox
script:

<p>This technically seems to work, but it redundantly runs all my tests in each version of Python...from each version of Python. So a build that takes 5 minutes now takes 45 minutes.</p>

<p>I tried removing the <code>python</code> list from my yaml file, so Travis will only run a single Python instance, but that causes my Python3.5 tests to fail because the 3.5 interpreter can't be found. Apparently, that's a <a href=""https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/4794"" rel=""noreferrer"">known limitation</a> as Travis-CI won't install Python3.5 unless you specify that exact version in your config...but it doesn't do that for the other versions.</p>

"<p>In my React Native app, I have a situation where one particular child of a component that I <code>render</code> should receive either a green or red <code>borderColor</code>. </p>

<p>Now, I don't want to create two separate entries in my <code>styles</code> for these two situations since they only differ in the <code>borderColor</code> property.</p>

<p>My question: 
1) Is this an Android Studio 2.1 problem?  Have others seen it?
2) Assuming this is my error and since the error message gives no help in finding the bad module, are there any recommendations on finding the V52 code?  I can't just omit the libraries without breaking large amount of code.  Can one inspect a .jar file to find the code revision?
Thanks in advance.

"Assuming I have an array of data as follows..

Where windowSize is the number of array positions to be evaluated, pointsTaken is the number of dataPoints to be returned.

So I know I'll need the sum from which to gain the mean. I will need to calculate the math.abs for each array position in relation to the mean and compare each result to find the datapoint array position furthest from the mean and then return that original datapoint value to a new array.

"<p>I need to draw a list of shapes and I am using Direct2D. I get the list of shapes from a file. The list is sorted and the order of the elements inside the file represents the order these shapes will be drawn. So, if for example the file specifies two rectangle in the same position and with the same sizes, only the second one will be visible (since the first will be overwritten).</p>

<p>Given my list of shapes I proceede to its drawing in the following way:</p>

<pre><code>list&lt;Shape&gt; shapes;

for (const auto&amp; shape : shapes)
   shape.draw();
</code></pre>

<p>It is straightforward to see that if I have two shapes I cannot invert the order of the drawing operations, and this means that I must be sure that <code>shape2</code> will be always drawn after <code>shape1</code> and so on. Follows that I can not use multiple threads to draw my shapes, and this is a huge disadvantage in terms of performances.</p>

<p>I read that Direct3D supports the depth buffer (or z-buffer), which specifies for each pixel its z-coordinate, such that only the ""visible"" pixels (the onces closer to the viewer) will be drawn, <strong>regardless of the order in which the shapes are drawn</strong>. And I have the depth information of each shape when I read the file.</p>

<p>Is there a way to use the depth buffer in Direct2D, or a similar technique which allows me the use of multiple threads to draw my shapes?</p>

"<p>I just made an app that uses the HealthKit framework. However, I ran across one issue. Apparently, I need to submit a Privacy Policy with any app that uses the HealthKit Framework. When I go into iTunes Connect to add one the only option is to submit a URL that links to the Privacy Policy. Now the issue is that I don't have a website or anything like that to create a Privacy Policy. Is there a way I can just submit the the Privacy Policy as text instead of a URL or would I have to make a website?</p>

<p>so if I send a 'login' it will go and start a new <code>ChatDialog</code> conversation but it seems to get stuck in this state. Even if I try to send another command, it will keep asking for login. Do I implement another <code>Case</code> class to handle a 'Cancel' command? Or should it automatically cancel the conversation when the user sends the same 'login' command more than once? Seems kinda clunky to have to send a 'cancel' command separately.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
declare (strict_types = 1);    

function test (mixed $s) : mixed {
    return $s;
}

// Works
echo gettype ('hello');
// Does not work
echo test ('hello');
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When I run this code, I get the following.</p>

<pre><code>Fatal error: Uncaught TypeError: Argument 1 passed to test() must be an instance of mixed, string given, called in mixed.php on line 11 and defined in mixed.php:4
Stack trace:
#0 mixed.php(11): test('hello')
#1 {main}
thrown in mixed.php on line 4
</code></pre>

<p>If I comment out the call to test(), the code runs fine, so apparently it's at least okay for me to use the mixed parameter type in the function declaration.</p>

<p>I know built-in PHP functions such as gettype() can take mixed parameters, though I don't know if they are internally using strict typing.</p>

<p>I see that ""mixed"" is also used as a pseudo-type in PHP <a href=""https://secure.php.net/manual/en/language.pseudo-types.php"" rel=""noreferrer"">documentation</a>, so I might misunderstand the purpose of ""mixed"" as a PHP keyword, but what I'm seeing here at least implies to me that it is a legitimate keyword. Am I simply using it in a way it isn't intended for?</p>

<p>Finally, I realize I could circumvent all this by simply not specifying the parameter type, but I'd like to be consistent by specifying all my parameter and return types.</p>

<p>Thank you and please let me know if I can provide any additional information.</p>

<p>how does the return behave differently from the yield? I assume the return acts as a normal return statement, but the context of a generator function, does it also call <code>gen.return()</code> as well? Sort of confusing.</p>

"<p>I've been trying to use the new Angular 1.5 <code>component</code> syntax in a project, but I can't figure out how to inject a dependency into the component definition.</p>

<p>Here's my attempt at refactoring an existing directive to a component:</p>

<pre><code>angular

"<p>I'm trying to translate nodes on a newick formatted tree, and I'm having trouble getting the replacing right. Say I have the <code>HashMap</code>:</p>

<pre><code>""(1:"" : ""(30:""
"",1:"" : "",30:"" 
""(30:"" : ""(6:""
"",30:"" : "",6:""
</code></pre>

<p>And the tree:</p>

<pre><code>(30:0.07,(1:0.06,2:0.76))
</code></pre>

<p>Conventional wisdom would suggest multiple <code>replaceAll</code>, but this poses a problem: </p>

<pre><code>replaceAll(""(1:"", ""(30:"") &gt;&gt; (30:0.07,(30:0.06,2:0.76))
replaceAll(""(30:"", ""(6:"") &gt;&gt; (6:0.07,(6:0.06,2:0.76))
</code></pre>

<p>The problem here is we've replaced a node that was previously replaced. The correct tree should look like:</p>

<pre><code>(6:0.07,(30:0.06,2:0.76))
</code></pre>

<p>Now I've already done this in Python: </p>

<pre><code>def multiple_replace(taxa, text): 
    regex = re.compile(""|"".join(map(re.escape, taxa.keys())))
    return regex.sub(lambda mo: taxa[mo.group(0)], text)

<p>But I'm having trouble with my Java implementation:</p>

<pre><code>private String convertTree (String treeOld, HashMap&lt;String, String&gt; conv) {
        Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(""\\(\\d+:|,\\d+:"");
        Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(treeOld);
        StringBuilder sbt = new StringBuilder(treeOld);
        while (matcher.find()) {
            String replace = conv.get(matcher.group());
            System.out.println(matcher.group() + ""||"" +replace + "" || "" + matcher.start() + "":""+matcher.end());
            sbt.delete(matcher.start(), matcher.end());
            sbt.insert(matcher.start(), replace);
        }
        return treeOld;

    }

<p>While the replacing appears to work, I can't get the indexing quite correct with different sizes of strings (as shown in the example). Is there a way to do this in Java?</p>

"<p>Just a couple weeks ago, I learned that the C++ Standard had a strict aliasing rule.  Basically, I had asked a question about shifting bits -- rather than shifting each byte one at a time, to maximize performance I wanted to load my processor's native register's with (32 or 64 bits, respectively) and perform the shift of 4/8 bytes all in a single instruction.</p>

<p>This is the code I wanted to avoid:</p>

<pre><code>unsigned char buffer[] = { 0xab, 0xcd, 0xef, 0x46 };

for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; ++i)
{
  buffer[i] &lt;&lt;= 4; 
  buffer[i] |= (buffer[i + 1] &gt;&gt; 4);
}
buffer[3] &lt;&lt;= 4;
</code></pre>

<p>And instead, I wanted to use something like:</p>

<pre><code>unsigned char buffer[] = { 0xab, 0xcd, 0xef, 0x46 };
unsigned int *p = (unsigned int*)buffer; // unsigned int is 32 bit on my platform
*p &lt;&lt;= 4;
</code></pre>

<p>Someone called out in a comment that my proposed solution violated the C++ Aliasing rules (because p was of type <code>int*</code> and buffer was of type <code>char*</code> and I was dereferencing p to perform the shift. (Please ignore possible issues of alignment and byte order -- I handle those outside of this snippet)  I was quite surprised to learn about he Strict Aliasing rule since I regularly operate on data from buffers, casting it from one type to another and have never had any issue.  Further investigation revealed that the compiler I use (MSVC) doesn't enforce strict aliasing rules and since I only develop on gcc/g++ in my spare time as a hobby, I likely just hadn't encountered the issue yet.</p>

<p>So then I asked a question about Strict Aliasing Rules and C++'s Placement new operator:</p>

<p>IsoCpp.org offers a FAQ regarding placement new and they provide the following code example:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;new&gt;        // Must #include this to use ""placement new""
#include ""Fred.h""     // Declaration of class Fred
void someCode()
{
  char memory[sizeof(Fred)];     // Line #1
  void* place = memory;          // Line #2
  Fred* f = new(place) Fred();   // Line #3 (see ""DANGER"" below)
  // The pointers f and place will be equal
  // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>The example is simple enough, but I'm asking myself, ""What if someone calls a method on <code>f</code> -- e.g. <code>f-&gt;talk()</code>?  At that point we would be dereferencing <code>f</code>, which points to the same memory location as <code>memory</code> (of type <code>char*</code>. I've read numerous places that there is an exemption for variables of type <code>char*</code> to alias any type, but I was under the impression that it wasn't a ""two-way street"" -- meaning, <code>char*</code> can alias (read/write) any type <code>T</code>, but type <code>T</code> can only be used to alias a <code>char*</code> if <code>T</code> itself is of <code>char*</code>. As I'm typing this, that doesn't make any sense to me and so I'm leaning towards the belief that the claim that my initial (bit shifting example) violated the strict aliasing rule is false.</p>

<p>Can someone please explain what is correct? I've been going nuts with trying to understand what is legal and what is not (despite having read numerous websites and SO posts on the topic)</p>

"<p>As we know, function templates cannot be partially specialized in C++. When you are conceptually trying to achieve this, there are two possible solutions you can use. One of them is to use structs with a static function, optionally wrapped with a template function, like so:</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;class T, class U&gt;
struct BarHelper
{
    static void BarHelp(T t, const U&amp; u)
    {
        std::cerr &lt;&lt; ""bar general\n"";
    }
};

template &lt;class T&gt;
struct BarHelper&lt;T, double&gt;
{
    static void BarHelp(T t, const double&amp; u)
    {
        std::cerr &lt;&lt; ""bar specialized\n"";
    }
};
template &lt;class T, class U&gt;
void bar(T t, const U&amp; u)
{
    BarHelper&lt;T, U&gt;::BarHelp(t, u);
};
</code></pre>

<p><code>bar</code> here is optional, you can if you like just use the struct's static member directly (though you will have to then explicitly specify all arguments).</p>

<p>The other approach is just to overload function templates:</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;class T, class U&gt;
void func(T t, const U&amp; u)
{
    std::cerr &lt;&lt; ""func general\n"";

}
template &lt;class T&gt;
void func(T t, const double&amp; u)
{
    std::cerr &lt;&lt; ""func specialized\n"";
}
</code></pre>

<p>To me, it seems like the second approach is preferable. For starters it is much less verbose, and far clearer with regards to intent (we're writing functions, so let's use functions instead of pointless wrapper structs). Also, there are some nice tricks you can play with functions to control overload resolution. For instance, you can have non-templated ""tag"" arguments in an inheritance hierarchy, and use implicit conversion to control priority of functions. You also get implicit conversions anytime you concretely specify a type in an overload, and if you don't like that behavior you can just use enable_if on your overload to prevent it (bringing you back to par with structs).</p>

<p>Are there reasons to prefer the partially specialized structs? How general are these reasons? I.e. which should be your ""default""? Does this differ if you: a) plan to implement all specializations yourself, versus b) this is used as a customization point where users can inject their own behavior?</p>

<p>Herb Sutter has a famous blog post about avoiding function template specialization. In it, he also recommends (right near the end) preferring partially specialized structs to overloaded function templates, but he doesn't seem to give any concrete reasons: <a href=""http://www.gotw.ca/publications/mill17.htm"">http://www.gotw.ca/publications/mill17.htm</a>.</p>

  <p>Moral #2: If you're writing a function base template, prefer to write it as a single function template that should never be specialized or <em>overloaded</em></p>

"<p>In <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjTrfoiB0MQ"">this presentation </a> at around 00:19:00, Andrei Alexandrescu explains the implementation of his <code>SCOPE_EXIT</code> macro. He creates a <code>ScopeGuard</code> object on the stack that executes a lambda on destruction:</p>

<pre><code>#define ANONYMOUS_VARIABLE(str) \
    CONCATENATE(str, __COUNTER__)

namespace detail {
    enum class ScopeGuardOnExit {};
    template &lt;typename Fun&gt;
    ScopeGuard&lt;Fun&gt;
    operator+(ScopeGuardOnExit, Fun&amp;&amp; fn) {
        return ScopeGuard&lt;Fun&gt;(std::forward&lt;Fun&gt;(fn));
    }
}

#define SCOPE_EXIT \
    auto ANONYMOUS_VARIABLE(SCOPE_EXIT_STATE) \
    = ::detail::ScopeGuardOnExit() + [&amp;]()
</code></pre>

<p>So far, so well known (he even states in his slides that this is an old hat). The usage looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>void foo()
{
    SCOPE_EXIT{ printf(""foo exits""); };
}
</code></pre>

<p>But at 01:04:00, Chandler Carruth claims that this usage of the <code>__COUNTER__</code> macro to create an ""anonymous"" name would cause an ODR violation when used in an inline function. Can this be true? The macro is only used to create a local variable name, not a type name or something, so how could this cause an ODR violation?</p>

Now I want to acces the first / second / tird / fourth element to pass it on

"<p>I'm trying to figure out <strong>how and where</strong> to load the data (ie call dispatch on my action) for my select box in react + redux + thunk. I'm not sure if it should go in the constructor of my App container, or should i load it inside my component (in my example: ""MyDropdown"")</p>

It seems to make sense to put the initialize data and call to actions there as it'll be all centralized, instead of calling actions inside my child components. Also, i'll have multiple select boxes that need to be loaded on startup, so my App class might grow quite a bit, is that the correct way to do it?

"<p><strong>What I'm Doing</strong><br>
I have a component that hides/shows using <code>*ngIf</code> based on a simple Boolean. When the component becomes visible I want to apply focus to a child element within its template.</p>

If I flip the Boolean value the component shows correctly but if I then try and get a reference to the child element using <code>this._elRef.nativeElement.querySelector(""div#test"")</code> it just comes back <code>null</code>. If I wait a few seconds the same code will return the reference to the element as I expected.</p>

So what I'm wondering is, how can I be sure that my <code>ngIf</code> has taken effect and the elements are their in the DOM to be selected?<br>Is there such a thing as a callback for <code>ngIf</code> or can I force the view to update and get a callback from that?</p>

<p>Also, in case it's relevant, I did a potentially stupid thing earlier when it was giving me similar warnings about VTK. It was telling me that /user/bin/vtk was renamed or something, and it was.  This version of VTK called itself vtk6. I tried to root around in the makefiles to find that and change it so Cmake would know to look for vtk6, but I couldn't find it anywhere, so I went into the bin and made a copy of vtk6 named vtk, and it stopped giving me a warning. </p>

"Take a look at these codes :

        bool b3 = e3 != 0;  // = true
        bool b4 = e4 != 0;  // = true   

Upper Codes in other way(simpler) :   
 

        const int a = 1 << 0;  // = 1
        const int b = 1 << 1;  // = 2
        const int c = 1 << 2;  // = 4
        const int d = 1 << 3;  // = 8

        bool b2 = (flag & b) != 0;  // = true
        bool b3 = (flag & c) != 0;  // = true
        bool b4 = (flag & d) != 0;  // = true   

I need a **Reverse Formula** to return `flag` value when we set :   
**b1 , b2 , b3 , b4** variables and make them constant.   

So we have `2*2*2*2 = 16` different situations. mean `(true|flase)*(true|flase)*(true|flase)*(true|flase) = 16`   

With which method we can figure out what should `flag` be?   

Mean :   

        const int a = 1 << 0;  // = 1
        const int b = 1 << 1;  // = 2
        const int c = 1 << 2;  // = 4
        const int d = 1 << 3;  // = 8
    
        int flag = ?;
    
        bool b1 = (? & a) != 0;  // = true > I WANT b1 True
        bool b2 = (? & b) != 0;  // = false > I WANT b2 False
        bool b3 = (? & c) != 0;  // = false > I WANT b3 True
        bool b4 = (? & d) != 0;  // = true > I WANT b4 False

For example i want `b1 True , b2 False , b3 True , b4 False`. So What is the flag?   
Or   
I want  `b1 False, b2 False , b3 True , b4 False`. So What is the flag?   
How did you find it and give me a method to calculate it!   
<hr>
In my example `flag` is 15 (sum of a+b+c+d) and in this way all `b` variables are true.

Here, Ruby comes in action its the one,processing and publishing,being the core f the platform.I wanted to add a function that generates thumbnails from the webcam videos,and added it into the publishing script.So now after the process script is done,comes the publish script,checks if webcam video exists or not,if yes it copies it into the publishing directory,then it generates the thumbnails,my problem here is that after adding the ruby function,the whole publish script can't be executed anymore,and i am getting a publish.fail error

"<p>There are several ways to handle synchronization in Vulkan. This is how I understand it:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fences are GPU to CPU syncs.</li>
<li>Semaphores are GPU to GPU syncs, they are used to sync queue
submissions (on the same or different queues).</li>
<li>Events are more general, reset and checked on both CPU and GPU.</li>
<li>Barriers are used for synchronization inside a command buffer.</li>

"<p>For a while, I have been noticing that TensorFlow (v0.8) does not seem to fully use the computation power of my Titan X. For several CNNs that I have been running the GPU usage does not seem to exceed ~30%. Typically the GPU utilization is even lower, more like 15%. One particular example of a CNN that shows this behavior is the CNN from DeepMind's Atari paper with Q-learning (see link below for code). </p>

<p>When I see other people of our lab running CNNs written in Theano or Torch the GPU usage is typically 80%+. This makes me wondering, why are the CNNs that I write in TensorFlow so 'slow' and what can I do to make more efficient use of the GPU processing power? Generally, I am interested in ways to profile the GPU operations and discover where the bottlenecks are. Any recommendations how to do this are very welcome since this seems not really possible with TensorFlow at the moment.</p>

<p>Things I did to find out more about the cause of this problem:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Analyzing TensorFlow's <strong>device placement</strong>, everything seems to be on gpu:/0 so looks OK.</p></li>
<li><p>Using <strong>cProfile</strong>, I have optimized the batch generation and other preprocessing steps. The preprocessing is performed on a single thread, but the actual optimization performed by TensorFlow steps take much longer (see average runtimes below). One obvious idea to increase the speed is by using TFs queue runners, but since the batch preparation is already 20x faster than optimization I wonder whether this is going to make a big difference.</p>

<pre><code>Avg. Time Batch Preparation: 0.001 seconds
Avg. Time Train Operation:   0.021 seconds
Avg. Time Total per Batch:   0.022 seconds (45.18 batches/second)

"<p>Rust performs type inference in fairly advanced situations. Could someone please explain (or point to) the rules that describe what can and cannot be inferred?</p>

<p>The first one is simple: The type of a binding is the type of the bound expression:</p>

<pre><code>let n = 10u32;

// Same as:
//   vvvvv
let n: u32 = 10u32;
</code></pre>

<p>This next one is more surprising to me: The generic parameter on the right is deduced from the binding type on the left:</p>

<pre><code>let n: u32 = ""10"".parse().unwrap();

// same as:            vvvvvvv
let n: u32 = ""10"".parse::&lt;u32&gt;().unwrap();
</code></pre>

<p>This also works for ""member functions"" of generic types:</p>

<pre><code>let b = Box::new(10u32);

// same as:
//        vvvvv      vvvvvvv
let b: Box&lt;u32&gt; = Box::&lt;u32&gt;::new(10u32);
</code></pre>

<p>But the strangest of all is type inference across statements:</p>

<pre><code>let v = Vec::new();   // no type!
v.push(10u32);        // apparently v is Vec&lt;u32&gt;?!
// v.push(10i32);     // type error
</code></pre>

<p>What are the rules for type inference and type deduction?</p>

    YZ_Patches = np.float32(image_pad[indeces[0],                 indeces[1]:indeces[1]+m,  indeces[2]:indeces[2]+m])

    return XY_Patches, XZ_Patches, YZ_Patches


def Patch_triplanar_para(image_path, patch_size):

    Image, Label, indeces =  Sampling(image_path)

    n = (patch_size -1)/2
    m = patch_size

    image_pad = np.pad(Image, pad_width=n, mode='constant', constant_values = 0)

<p>I have been experimenting with ""n_jobs"", expecting that increasing this will speed up my function. However as I increase n_jobs, things slow down quite significantly. When running this code without ""Parallel"", things are slower, until I increase the number of jobs from 1. </p>

"<p>C (and C++) include a family of dynamic memory allocation functions, most of which are intuitively named and easy to explain to a programmer with a basic understanding of memory. <code>malloc()</code> simply allocates memory, while <code>calloc()</code> allocates some memory and clears it eagerly. There are also <code>realloc()</code> and <code>free()</code>, which are pretty self-explanatory.</p>

<p>The manpage for <code>malloc()</code> also mentions <code>valloc()</code>, which allocates (<code>size</code>) bytes <em>aligned to the page border</em>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, my background isn't thorough enough in low-level intricacies; what are the implications of allocating and using page border-aligned memory, and when is this appropriate as opposed to regular <code>malloc()</code> or <code>calloc()</code>?</p>

"What is the correct way to use inheritance among multiple files?

I am new to C++, and I am trying to create a class for all my GDI+ related functions which I'm gonna use in my separate cpp files. I have tried several approaches and to be able to find the problem more easily I got to trying with empty constructor.

I get LNK2019 with this code (I took away parts which are unrelated to the issue, only what is related to WndFuncs class was left):

Header of functions file:

	#ifndef WNDFUNCS_H
	#define WNDFUNCS_H

	class WndFuncs
	{
	private:
	public:
		WndFuncs(); //declaration
	};

	#include ""stdafx.h""

	#include <windows.h>
	#include <commctrl.h>
	#include <winuser.h>
	#include <gdiplus.h>
	#include ""WndFuncs.h""

	WndFuncs::WndFuncs() //definition
	{

	}

The header of class that tries to inherit the class:

	#ifndef SEARCHEDITBOX_H
	#define SEARCHEDITBOX_H

	class SearchEditBox : public WndFuncs
	{
	private:
		WndFuncs WndFuncs;

		SearchEditBox();
        ...

	public:
		~SearchEditBox();
        ...

	#endif

The the class file:

    #include ""WndFuncs.h""
    #include ""SearchEditBox.h""

    SearchEditBox::SearchEditBox()
    	: WndFuncs()
    {
	    ...	
    }

The error is:

> LNK2019	unresolved external symbol ""public: __thiscall
> WndFuncs::WndFuncs(void)"" (??0WndFuncs@@QAE@XZ) referenced in function
> ""private: __thiscall SearchEditBox::SearchEditBox(void)""
> (??0SearchEditBox@@AAE@XZ)

I have read the explanation and all the points on the [MSDN page][1] (even tried putting ""__cdecl"" into the function declaration), I am sure the function is declared AND defined (in the class files; I also tried with `const int x` thinking that the problem may be in empty constructor), so the WndFuncs file should be fine.

I have read [this][2] and my assumption is that I declare the class in the wrong way in the inheriting file (and the linker thus can't link to correct functions in WndFuncs class), but even when I am trying to do everything as described in [here][3] it does not help either. I am not using any virtual members so the problem should not be related to that (as pointed out on that page).

When I add destructor to the WndFuncs class I get 2 LNK2019 errors, so the problem should not be related to that also. I also have the header files in right order I think (tried both). 

I tried also with other function (with or without constructor) with same error.

"Google wasn't being much help for my specific issue do I thought I'd finally sign up for SO.

I have my site at a host and my domain with a registrar. I have a subdomain pointed to my hosted site via an A record.

From the beginning. I am using cloudways hosting. I set up my site. (A wordpress site.) I then went to my registrar and set up an A record to point to my site. It worked. The A record was simply sub.mysite.c om. I then tested that url and it worked. So I made a second A record for www.sub.mysite.c om so I could be able to get to my site with or without www. The www worked. So far so good.

Since I had everything working I decided to set up my SSL. CloudWays has Let's Encrypt integration. So ithas the option to set it up for you. I set it up and went to h ttps://sub.mysite.c om. It worked. I then went to h ttps://www.sub.mysite.com. and got a certificate error. I didn't think about it when I set up the cert, but I used sub.mysite.c om. So it makes sense the site only works without the www.

Since Let's Encrypt doesn't do wildcard certs I need a work around. Is there a way I can forward h ttps://www.mysub to h ttps://mysub? using mod rewrite? Or any other way?",LQ

        let formData: any = new FormData()

        }
        xhr.open(""POST"", url, true)
        xhr.send(formData)
    })
}

<p>So it works, the files are being uploaded and the backend replies a 200 response. But in the method where I use this function, I do this :</p>

<pre><code>        this.makeFileRequest(""theurl"", this.listFiles)
        .map(res =&gt; res.json())
            .subscribe(
                res =&gt; console.log(res),
                error =&gt; console.log(""fails"")
            )
</code></pre>

<p>But tslint tells me this for at the map point :</p>

<pre><code>TS2339 Property 'map' does not exist on type 'Promise&lt;{}&gt;'.
</code></pre>

<p>So I think it would be better to manage the makeFileRequest function so it returns an Observable instead of a Promise.
And just in case, note I import ""rxjs/add/operator/map"".</p>

"<p>I have a table view with a bunch of cells in it. I want to get the frame of a cell, not in its superview's coordinate space, but in the table view's coordinate space.</p>

<p>A picture would probably explain this better</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FPQEom.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FPQEom.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>See the red rectangle? That is the frame of the table cell. And the blue rectangle is the frame of the table view. I want to get the red rectangle that is relative to the blue rectangle.</p>

<p>I tried to use the <code>frame</code> property of <code>UITableViewCell</code>. But that doesn't work because it returns (0, 0, 320, 44). The Y value shouldn't be zero because obviously the cell is not at the top of the screen.</p>

<p>According to the view hierarchy, this is the intended behaviour, because the superview of a table cell is apparently this <code>UITableViewWrapperView</code>, not the table view:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/biOOY.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/biOOY.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7feC0.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7feC0.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>So is there a method/property that can get me a <code>CGRect</code> that represents the frame of the table view cell in the coordinate space of the table view?</p>

<p>I think there is a function that can convert a <code>CGRect</code> in a coordinate space to another. But I forgot its name and how to use it. I don't know whether it is helpful in this situation.</p>

"<p>I want to ensure I have understood Redux right. My understanding is that it will store the <em>complete</em> state of an application (including all subsystems) like models of all components and cache of fetched data and user generated data. Does that mean I should never use service to load/save state of an component by it's model's id?</p>

<p>I'm making an quiz application, which consist of components like <em>Quiz</em>, <em>Category</em>, <em>Question</em> and <em>Choice</em>. Currently each component calls the web API to fetch data and maintains it's own state itself or with the aid of an service which keeps track of everything by id fields.</p>

<p>I have dedicated service called <em>AnswerService</em> to maintain the state of selected choices, where each <em>Choice</em> component fetches it's state when rendered.</p>

<p>Does migrating to Redux means all of this will be moved to store, and virtually all service will be stateless and dispatch directly to store, and respectively all component models are subscribed from store?</p>

<p>If you use <code>IDatabase.StringGet(key)</code> then the returning of Null is used to signify that there ""was no result"".

"<p>I have a Rails app, I recently updated to <code>5.0.0.RC1</code>. Most of the transition went smooth, but I'm having some trouble with the new Turbolinks. In my app I for example use this gem:</p>

<p>My <code>application.js</code> file looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>//= require jquery

//= require jquery_ujs
//= require best_in_place
//= require tether
//= require bootstrap
//= require chosen-jquery
//= require_tree .
//= require turbo links

<p>When I click on a link and render a view my <code>chosen-query</code> (<code>best_in_place</code> doesn't work as well) doesn't work in the initial load, but if I make a hard refresh of the page then it works. Below is an image of the result I'm getting:</p>

<p>After a <code>redirect_to</code> it results in the following HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;select name=""screen"" id=""screen-selection"" class=""form-control chosen-select""  style=""max-width: 250px !important""&gt;[...]&lt;/select&gt;

<p>... and after a hard page reload I get this:</p>

I need to do this because I need to determine if there is any native win32 ListBox under a certain screen point. The first step is to find the control handle using `WindowFromPoint` function, but next we need to check if the found handle is of a ListBox or not.

Are there any examples of code that breaks, either binary-wise or source-wise, after the layout of a struct in a library it uses is changed?</p>

<p>NOTE: By ""breaks,"" I mean it fails to compile at all or the IL is invalidated. So for example I wouldn't consider this a breaking change:</p>

<pre><code>// My.Library v1
public struct MyStruct {}

// My.Library v2
public struct MyStruct { int _field; }

// App code
using My.Library;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

Console.WriteLine(Marshal.SizeOf&lt;MyStruct&gt;()); // before printed 1, now prints 4

"<p>I've been banging my head against this one trying to figure it out, and no amount of documentation I've been able to read has given me an answer to my question.</p>

<p>I have a service which is speaking directly to an API and returning an observable event which under normal circumstances I would subscribe to and do what I want with the data, however in a secondary service which utilizes the requests from the restful service, I need to be able to return values from the request.</p>

<pre><code>getSomething() {
    return this._restService.addRequest('object', 'method').run()
        .subscribe(
            res =&gt; {
                res;
            },
            err =&gt; {
                console.error(err);
            }
        );
}

returnSomething() {
    return this.getSomething();
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the quick example above, I want to know if there is any way I can return <code>res</code> from <code>getSomething()</code> within <code>returnSomething()</code>. If it's not achievable in this way, what is the alternative? I will add that the _restService is pretty heavily relied upon and I don't really want to start messing with that.</p>

"<p>TypeScript newbie question. In our project, we are using some external JavaScript libraries where we needed to add *.d.ts files. I understand this use case and the reason why we needed to do this.</p>

<p>But, for our own interfaces that we are defining, one of my developers suggested that we define them in *.d.ts files so that we could have access to the interface type without importing it into the modules that need to use it.</p>

<p>For example, we wanted to create an interface for an ""error-first callback"" function so that we could reuse it in many areas.</p>

<p>So instead of this...</p>

<pre><code>export function helloWorldEventually(callback: (err: Error, result: any) =&gt; void) {
  callback(null, 'Hello World');
}
</code></pre>

<p>We could define an interface for the error first callback like this...</p>

<pre><code>export interface ErrorFirstCallback {
  (err: Error, result: any): void;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And use it like this...</p>

<pre><code>export function helloWorldEventually(callback: ErrorFirstCallback) {
  callback(null, 'Hello World');
}
</code></pre>

<p>At first, I just defined the ErrorFirstCallback interface in ErrorFirstCallback.ts, and imported it in order to reference it.</p>

<p>Another developer suggested we put in in a *.d.ts file and then we would not need to import it in order to reference it.</p>

<p>When should interfaces that we are defining be defined in a *.d.ts file vs a *.ts file.</p>

"<p>I already know how <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/concurrency/index.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Event Dispatch thread</a> works. If there be short and long events in Event Dispatch thread like below, the application can't be responsive.     </p>

<p>For the Sake of responsiveness in Swing, Event Dispatch thread should only be used for short events. while long events should be executed on SwingWorkers.    </p>

The events should be executed in Event Dispatch thread and you have a special event which you want to be executed before other events existing in Event Dispatch Thread queue. But, events will be enqueued to the end of the queue by default and even <code>InvokeLater</code> do the same.     </p>

"<p>There are 2 things that I'm very confused about.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What is the advantage of using any of ES6 class or Object literals.</p></li>
<li><p>And where should I use any of them?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Some of the examples that I'm trying out are mentioned below. Please let me know when to use particular way of implementation and when not to.</p>

<p>Class Example 1:</p>

<pre><code>// auth.js
class Auth {
  login(req, res) {...}
  signup(req, res) {...}
}

module.exports = new Auth();

// index.js
const auth = require('auth');
</code></pre>

<p>Class Example 2:</p>

<pre><code>// auth.js
class Auth {
  login(req, res) {...}
  signup(req, res) {...}
}

module.exports = Auth;

// index.js
const Auth = require('auth');
const auth = new Auth();
</code></pre>

<p>Object Literal Example:</p>

<pre><code>// auth.js
module.exports = {
  login: (req, res) =&gt; {...},
  signup: (req, res) =&gt; {...}
};

// index.js
const auth = require('auth');
</code></pre>

<p>What I think from reading about them is that:</p>

<p><strong>Class Example 1:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>You can not create more than 1 object. Because a module is only executed once. So, on every import you will get the same object. Something similar to singleton. (Correct me here if I misunderstood it)</p></li>
<li><p>You will not be able to access the static methods of the class because you are only exporting the object of the class.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Class Example 2:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>If you have a class that contains nothing but helper methods and the object does not have any state, It makes no sense creating object of this class all the time. So, in case of helper classes, this should not be used.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Object Literal Example:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>You can not do inheritance.</p></li>
<li><p>Same object will be passed around on every require. (Correct me if I'm wrong here as well)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Please help me understand these concepts, what I'm missing out, what I've misunderstood and what should be used when and where. I'll be very grateful for your help.</p>

<p>But what happens with prerender?  If I create a file like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;my-app&gt;
    &lt;!--template bindings={
        ""ng-reflect-ng-for-of"": ""1,2,3""

  &lt;/my-app&gt;
  &lt;SCRIPTS/&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

<p>What will Angular do once scripts are loaded? Can I use this html instead of the first one? If someone understands how this process works, please share (; Any info about this stuff would be useful... Can I <strong><em>Copy outerHTML</em></strong>, and make that my ""prerendered page""? ...like this:</p>

"<p>I've been trying to figure this out for a while and I'm getting more and more confused.</p>

<p>I want to reset/change Redux state every time I leave or change route. I'm using <code>react-router-redux</code> with <code>history.listener</code> dispatching an action every time route changes</p>

<p>Action creator:</p>

<pre><code>export function resetManualsCategory() {

"<p>Consider this simple program:</p>

replace(begin(foo), end(foo), foo.front(), 13);

for(const auto&amp; i : foo) cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; '\t';

<p>When I wrote it I expected to get:</p>

  <p>13    42  13  42  13  42</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But instead I got:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>13    42  0   42  0   42  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem of course is that <code>replace</code> takes in the last 2 parameters by reference. So if either of them happen to be in the range being operated on the results may be unexpected. I <em>can</em> solve this by adding a temporary variable:</p>

<pre><code>vector&lt;int&gt; foo = {0, 42, 0, 42, 0, 42};
const auto temp = foo.front();
replace(begin(foo), end(foo), temp, 13);

for(const auto&amp; i : foo) cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; '\t';

<p>I do know that C++11 gave us all kinds of type tools is it possible that I could simply force this value to a non-reference type and pass that inline, without creating the temporary?</p>

<p>It looks like the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise"" rel=""noreferrer"">native Promise function</a> is being used, with no argument being passed to it's <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/resolve"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>resolve</code></a> function which takes an:</p>

<blockquote>

<pre><code>var self = this;
setTimeout(function() {
    self._updateTableSizes.bind(self, true)
}, 0);

<p>...basically, freeing the JavaScript run-time event-loop to finish other things (like rendering) and then come right back to the callback?</p>

"<p>I would like to know how to get the X or Y position of nth item in RecyclerView. This is easy to do if the item is currently within the visible range. However, when the view is currently off the screen (e.g., current visible items range on the RecyclerView is 4 to 7, while the item I am interested in is, say, 1 or 10), there seems to be no way to get that value.</p>

<p>Here's what I have tried. I have the following three fields:</p>

<pre><code>private RecyclerView rv;

/* The Layout Manager of rv */
private LinearLayoutManager llm;

/* The data to be shown in the RecyclerView. */
private String[] data = {""0"",""1"",""2"",...,""9""};

<p>I have the items ""2"" to ""5"" shown on the screen, and I want to get the X/Y position of the item ""9"", which is currently off the screen. So I tried the following:</p>

<pre><code>int index = 9;
View v = rv.getChildAt(index);
View v2 = llm.getChildAt(index);
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, both <code>v</code> and <code>v2</code> are null. The reason for it seems to be that while the size of <code>data</code> is 10, the childCount of <code>rv</code> and <code>llm</code> is whatever the number of views currently visible on the screen, as evidenced by the following:</p>

<pre><code>int count = rv.getChildCount();
int count2 = llm.getChildCount();
</code></pre>

<p>Both variables are 4 (the number of views currently visible; i.e., ""2"" to ""5""). Since the size of the recyclerView is 4, and I want to look up the item at index 9, I get null returned above.</p>

Is it getting it from selenium, or does Maven house these artifacts, and it is getting from Maven?
Where exactly is it downloading the artifact from?

What's in the artifact file?  Class definitions?  Multiple classes can be defined in there, right?

Maven seems to be making a jar file.  Is it compounding all the classes into that file?

"Very basic question, new to programming, but I don't get how to call the main constructor in Java.

In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence

"My c# code is using a third-party library, written in C++ and using Swig to wrap it in C# (*three projects here, MyCodeCS, ThirdCpp and ThirdCs*)

So if I have class Acpp with public constructors Acpp() and Acpp(int) in cpp, I end up in the wrapped c# version with class Acs, properly defined constructors Acs() and Acs(int) (so far, so good), both of them using an internal, swig-generated, constructor: Acs(IntPtr cPtr,bool).

*(Of course both the cpp and the cs classes are named A, but for clarity I'll named them with the cpp and cs suffixes)*

Now, I am integrating a new cpp module (MyCodeCpp), which contains a class Bcpp, which inherits from Acpp. So far, so good: Bcpp inherits from Acpp, and I can call it from my c# code with no problem, using its IntPtr. 

**My issue** is that for the only purpose of having my Bcs objects recognized as being a Acs, I need to define such Bcs class. Which is a pretty dumb one since I already got the cptr:

`public class Bcs : Acs
{
public Bcs(IntPtr cptr): base(cptr,true){}
}`

The thing is... Acs(IntPtr,bool) is internal, which means that if I want to do that I need to either:

 - add Bcs into thirdCS project and rebuild thirdCS, which is what I do right now and which works fine but displeases my chief architect because now we have a class which is supposed to belong to MyCodeCS as is a wrapper to a class of MyCodeCpp, which actually belongs to thirdCs
 - **somehow modify the swig behavior so that Acs(IntPtr,bool) is protected internal instead of internal**, so it can be called by a MyCodeCS-based Bcs class

The thing is: I have no clue how to do that or even if it is possible ?

"<p>I am having trouble computing a likelihood ratio test in Python 2.7.</p>

L2 = 467414. # log(likelihood) of my 2nd fit

print 'p: %.30f' % p # p = 1.000000000000000000000000000000

five_sigma = 1 - scipy.special.erf(5 / np.sqrt(2.))                  :-)

<ul>
<li>My p-value is coming out to be 1 when I'd have expected it to be close to 0.</li>
<li>When I use the formula on the line marked with the :-) to find five sigma, for example, it differs from the value quoted in the literature - that line is highlighted with a :-(.

"<p>I am trying to get the EventEmitter in my own class running in ES6:</p>

"<p>I've been trying to implement some unit tests for a module. An example module named <em>alphabet.py</em> is as follows:</p>

    return True if letter in letters else False


letters = database.get('letters')   # returns a list of letters

"<p>I have a few tables with more than 100+ millions of rows.
I get about 20-40 millions of rows each month.</p>

<p>At this moment everything seems fine:
- all inserts are fast
- all selects are fast ( they are using indexes and don't use complex aggregations )</p>

<p>However, I am worried about two things, what I've read somewhere:
- When a table has few hundred millions of rows, there might be slow inserts, because it might take a while to re-balance the indexes ( binary trees )
- If index doesn't fit into memory, it might take a while to read it from the different parts of the disk.</p>

I can call messages from other methods by using System.out.println but thats the only i can do with methods.

I've got a *Plain Text* field in my application and I would like to set the text of this dynamically. I've given the plain text field the ID of: ""resultText"". Here's what I try;

        public void calcnums(View v)
    {
        int x=firstNum + seondNum;
        resultText.setText(""Result: "" + x);

"I met a problem when I try to extract a segment from a string using JAVA. The original string is looks like ""test/data/20/0000893220-97-000850.txt"""", and I wanna extract the segment which is behind the third ""/"". My regular expression is like

However, if I cast MyInternalto IMyInterface first, it would get rid of the error but would stop being useful because it's a new list and not the original list:

"Is there any way to rounding float for case like this question title above ?

This is the example case :

"This is a super basic question but I couldn't find a solution anywhere.  I've looked at the docs and on Stack Overflow.  I need to get a numpy array of strings which I will then save as a csv.

When I try dtype=string that does not work it gives me an error: `TypeError: data type not understood.`  I've tried `dtype='string'`, `dtype = np.str` `dtype = np.str_` and quite a few more but none of them get the dtype to be string.

So, I made a few <a href=""https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/test-users"">test users</a> to test it with more users. But, whenever I login as a test user, I can't seem to message the page. As a test user, I can't access the page, and a direct Messenger link gives an ""access denied"" page.</p>

<p>As an admin, I tried to add this test users as a ""Tester"" under the roles, but I also get more ""access denied"" messages. </p>

<p>So, is there a way to use a Facebook Test User to interact with my pre-approved Messenger Bot?</p>

"<p>We are now experimenting with multi-branch Pipeline builds. The main advantage of the feature is that it allows us to automatically create new Jenkins jobs whenever a new branch is created.</p>

<p>However, it also is a bit more difficult to implement than the old way of selecting how to do the build using the UI. Plus, certain features seem to be missing.</p>

<p>For example, in Jenkins Freestyle jobs, we are able to use the Jenkins UI to browse through the workspace, download individual files, and even wipe out the workspace. We found this helpful when builds went awry or if the developer needed a particular built asset that wasn't archived.</p>

<p>I've noticed in the Jenkins Pipeline jobs the UI no longer offers access to the workspace. I know I can archive the workspace, but I really don't want to save it -- especially for each and every build. I simply want to be able to browse the workspace or clean it out if something is causing problems with the build process.</p>

<p>Is there a way to get back this feature via the pipeline? I don't want to archive the workspace for each build (space issues), but I do want to be able to see what the workspace looks like if there are problems.</p>

This person seems to be doing what I want to do, however they do not show exactly how, or at least the part I need. 

I am also attaching a part of the perl script in case it is better to approach it from that end, but again I have very little experience with perl (warning perl script is long).

"i was trying hard to find a solution for automated background remove. target images are modeling images with white/gray gradient background which are sometimes a nightmare for background remove. for example i tried this image which the model wears white dress and background is also white/gray:

[before][1]
[after][2]
  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/k7ZS5.jpg
  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/NAmcJ.jpg

but as you can see, there are much noise on the image, and its not because of the quality.its because of using gimp>color>levels. i use it to make image edges stronger so edge detector can detect it. 

and if you are interested, this is how i achieved the results:

    colors > level -> 0- 0.1 - 255
    filters> blure > blure (default) **optional**
    filters > edge detector > edge... >smear 2.0
    colors> hue:180  lightness/saturation:-100

so, how can i remove this noise? (automatic, not manual)
and do you know any better idea for auto background remove from these kind of images?

"<p>I'm using Jekyll on GitHub pages, and I want to have hierarchical categories like this:</p>

<li>animals -> mammals -> dogs -> _posts -> poodle.md, doberman.md</li>
<li>animals -> reptiles -> lizards -> _posts -> iguana.md, chameleon.md</li>
</ul>

<p>I'd like users to be able to visit <code>/animals</code> and see a listing of every post from every category. But if they go to <code>/animals/mammals</code>, they'd only see mammals. If they go to <code>/animals/mammals/cats</code>, then they only see cats.</p>

<p>I know I can do this manually by putting an <code>index.html</code> file in every single directory and then looping through <code>site.categories.mammals</code> or <code>site.categories.cats</code>, for example.</p>

<p>But that seems a little bit too brute force, and I'm hoping there's a better way. If I want to change how I'm showing the listings, I'll have to change that in every single subcategory. I'll also have problems when subcategories share a name, like <code>/ABC/XYZ/_posts/one.md</code> and <code>/DEF/XYZ/_posts/two.md</code>.</p>

"<p>This is a similar to <a href=""http://www.stackoverflow.com/questions/30360391"">question 30360391</a>. I want to express that the parameter of a function is a plain JS object that can have arbitrary properties (with unknown) names but all properties are objects themselves with fixed properties.</p>

<p>An example: The function is just like this</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * @param {Descriptor} desc
 */
function foo( desc ) {
  // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>and a typical <code>desc</code> looks like</p>

<pre><code>desc = {
  unknownEntity1: {
    priority: 5;
    writable: false;
  },
  unknownEntity2: {
    priority: 42;
    writable: true;
  },
  unknownEntity3: {
    priority: 9;
    writable: false;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I already have</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * @typedef {Object} DescriptorEntry
 * @property {number} priority - The priority of the entity
 * @property {boolean} writable - True, if the entity can be modified
 */
</code></pre>

<p>I still need a <code>typedef</code> for <code>Descriptor</code> that basically express that Descriptor is an object with arbitrary properties but all of type <code>DescriptorEntry</code>. As pseudo-code it would be something like</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * @typedef {Object} Descriptor
 * @property {DescriptorEntry} *
 */
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, the asterisk <code>*</code> as a wildcard for ""any property"" is invalid Jsdoc syntax. But how do I do it correctly?</p>

"<p>I have encountered an odd problem the <em>second</em> time submitting an update to the app store. </p>

<p>I am building an app using Ionic Framework with a Java backend. Right now we use Firebase for user login. </p>

<p>We had a tough time getting our app onto the store this June because our server did not support ipv6 originally. After setting this up we got through review. But now that we are trying to submit an update (with a new reviewer) they cannot log into our app over ipv6 from a fresh install. </p>

<p>After further testing, we realized that our firebase url does not appear to be reachable over ipv6 (although we still haven't replicated the app review's report - our test correctly displays an error message, but they said that the app freezes).</p>

<p>I find it hard to believe firebase is not ipv6 enabled, but the testing indicates that that is the case. (once logged in ipv6 works fine with our server, we think firebase's capability to auto-relogin users offline is why we mistakenly made it into the store in the first place). Has anyone experienced similar issues with your firebase app? What did you do to resolve it? Did you end up having to abandon firebase or does the problem lie elsewhere?</p>

<p>p.s. I've looked long and hard but couldn't find any documentation about fireabse's compatibility with ipv6 or lack thereof. If anyone has seen this kind of documentation, that would also be immensely helpful.</p>

"<p>I'm having trouble accessing saved data after app starts with <a href=""https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist"" rel=""noreferrer"">redux-persist</a>.</p>

<p>The reducer initializes with data defined in my initial state. By the time the previous session's state loads with AsyncStorage, the component is already displayed with the default data. </p>

<p>I know that the data is saved and fetched successfully. If I leave the screen to a different one and come back to it, I can see that the data is displayed correctly. Debugging the state and props also shows that this is a async timing issue.</p>

<p>How can I delay the loading of the redux containers to after the store rehydrates. Alternatively, can I force update the conatainer (and its children) to update when the store finishes loading?</p>

<p>Here is what I've tried.
to configure my store:</p>

<pre><code>export default function configureStore(initialState) {
    const middlewares = [thunk];
    if (process.env.NODE_ENV === `development`) {
        const createLogger = require(`redux-logger`);
        const logger = createLogger();
        middlewares.push(logger);
    }

    let store = compose(
        applyMiddleware(...middlewares),
        autoRehydrate() )(createStore)(reducers);

        persistStore(store, {blacklist: ['routing'], storage: AsyncStorage}, () =&gt; {
            store.dispatch(storeRehydrateComplete())
        })


    return store
}
</code></pre>

<p>Hoping that this will update all other components (since all reducers in redux are called in an action), I've tried creating an action that triggers when the store finishes loading:</p>

<pre><code>import { REHYDRATE_STORE } from './types'

export function storeRehydrateComplete(){
    return {
        type: REHYDRATE_STORE,
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And it's reducer:
import { REHYDRATE_STORE } from '../actions/types'
const initialState = {
    storeIsReady: false
}</p>

<pre><code>export default function reducer(state = initialState, action){
    switch (action.type) {
        case REHYDRATE_STORE:
            return {...state, storeIsReady:true}
            break;
        default:
            return state
            break;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>But although the storeIsReady state changes to true when rehydration is complete, I'm still couldn't figure out how to force update the container component.</p>

So example the first replacement would be:

-  `$prep->bindValue(':PYOtherExpensesAmt',$summaryData['PYOtherExpensesAmt']);`

I've tried the following regexp:

`([?][$row], [))])`

Whenever I do <code>docker-compose down</code> it removes the the data from db but by doing <code>docker-compose stop</code> the data is not removed. May be this is because that I am not creating named data volume and <code>docker-compose down</code> hardly removes all the containers. So I tried naming the container but it threw me errors.

"<p>I'm new to Ionic and Typescript so apologies if I have this arse about face !</p>

<p>Im trying to build a simple iOS and Android app with Ionic 2 that simply displays the users current location, updating as they move.</p>

<p>The issue I am facing is that whilst I appear to be getting the co-ordinate locations come through the UI never updates to display the updated location.</p>

<p>I have created a provider using the cordova-plugin-mauron85-background-geolocation plugin as location.ts:</p>

<pre><code>import { Injectable, NgZone} from '@angular/core';
import { BackgroundGeolocation } from 'ionic-native';

@Injectable()
export class LocationProvider {

public message: any = ""I'm new here"";
public latitude:number = 0.0;
public longitude:number = 0.0;
private zone: NgZone;

constructor() {
   this.initialiseLocationManager();
}

initialiseLocationManager() {

let config = {
        desiredAccuracy: 1,
        stationaryRadius: 1,
        distanceFilter: 1,
        interval:1000,
        activityType:'AutomotiveNavigation',
        debug: true,
        stopOnTerminate: true,
};

BackgroundGeolocation.configure(config)
     .then(this.locationUpdated)
     .catch((error) =&gt; {
          console.log('BackgroundGeolocation error');
      });
}

private locationUpdated(location) {
   console.log('******* NEW LOCATION ********');
   this.zone.run(() =&gt; {
     this.latitude = location.latitude;
     this.longitude = location.longitude;
 });

 BackgroundGeolocation.finish(); // FOR IOS ONLY
}

private error(error) {
   console.log('ERROR');
}

public startTracking() {
  BackgroundGeolocation.start();
}

public stopTracking() {
   BackgroundGeolocation.stop();
}
}
</code></pre>

<p>I am then injecting this into my page test.ts:</p>

<pre><code>import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { NavController } from 'ionic-angular';
import {LocationProvider} from '../../providers/location/location';

@Component({
  templateUrl: 'build/pages/test/test.html', 
})
export class TestPage {

  constructor(private nav: NavController, private     locationProvider:LocationProvider) {

  }

  startTracking() {
    this.locationProvider.startTracking();
  }

  stopTracking() {
    this.locationProvider.stopTracking();
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>My page content is then:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ion-header&gt;

  &lt;ion-navbar&gt;
    &lt;button menuToggle&gt;
      &lt;ion-icon name=""menu""&gt;&lt;/ion-icon&gt;
    &lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;ion-title&gt;Test&lt;/ion-title&gt;
  &lt;/ion-navbar&gt;
&lt;/ion-header&gt;


&lt;ion-content padding&gt;
  &lt;button (click)=""startTracking()""&gt;
    Start Tracking
  &lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;button (click)=""stopTracking()""&gt;
    Stop Tracking
  &lt;/button&gt;

  &lt;ion-item&gt;Latitude / Longitude&lt;/ion-item&gt;
    &lt;ion-item&gt;
      {{locationProvider.latitude}},{{locationProvider.longitude}}
    &lt;/ion-item&gt;
&lt;/ion-content&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When I compile my app for iOS and run in Xcode it looks as I expect, when I click the ""Start Tracking"" button I see entries in the Xcode console that suggest the location is being obtained correctly i.e.</p>

When I click on the 3 bars button the navbar slides down then when I move my mouse away it slides back up. This is working perfectly fine but when ever I make the browser's width bigger the navbar is not there because in jquery i told it to slide up. How can i set jquery to slide up and down at a certain width and a bigger width just to show my navbar. I would like my navbar to collapse at a small width but at a bigger width i would like the whole navbar to show.

"<p>I'd like to understand under which circumstances variables which are no further used are stored in closures and lead to memory leaks. My most preferred outcome would be ""there are none"", but this doesn't seem to be the case.</p>

<p>From what I understand, once a function is declared inside another function, its internal [[scope]] is assigned the LexicalEnvironment of its encapsulating function. This LexicalEnvironment has reference local variables and the entire scope chain at that point. This basically includes <strong>all</strong> free variables the function could access (from what I understood of <a href=""https://lostechies.com/derekgreer/2012/02/17/javascript-closures-explained/"">lostechies, javascript closures explained</a>).</p>

<p>Here the first issue arises: this should mean <strong>all</strong> those variables can be reached as long as the function lives. E.g. the following should already leak:</p>

<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"" data-console=""false"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>function a() {
    let big = new Array(1000000).join('*'); //never accessed
    //function unused() { big; }
    return () =&gt; void 0;
}
 
let fstore = [];
function doesThisLeak() {
  for(let i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++) fstore.push(a());
}

doesThisLeak();</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>

<p>This luckily doesn't seem to be the case on my firefox. I've received several explanations to why this doesn't leak, from ""the jitter is smart"" to ""LexicalEnvironment is a record type which means GC can collect the unused variables"". I still don't know whether either is correct, whether this doesn't leak on all modern runtimes and why.</p>

<p>After further research, I found <a href=""https://auth0.com/blog/four-types-of-leaks-in-your-javascript-code-and-how-to-get-rid-of-them/"">auth0, four types of leaks in javascript</a> (sadly, there appears to be no html id to jump to, the relevant part is ""4: Closures"") which shows a way to trick whatever smart thing is collecting the unused variables. In above snippet, when just uncommenting the ""unused"" function, I do not see RAM usage ever going down again (it was already noted that it could be GC simply did not run for other reasons. However, so far, I am assuming it leaks. I also got told this was limited to firefox, but it appeared to produce similar behavior in chrome)</p>

<p>This example (in case it really does what i believe it does), shows that completely unused variables can leak due to a function declaration in the same scope.</p>

<p>To conclude my problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>What is the reason for, in the above snippet, ""big"" getting collected (when ""unused"" is commented) and does this happen on all modern runtimes?</li>
<li>Assuming the example with the ""unused"" function not commented leaks, what are best practices to avoid such accidental leaks? Are there any more? I already got the suggestion of null'ing all local variables which are not further used at the end of functions, however, this seems absurdly ugly. I fear using temporary variables for pre-calculations and accidentally leaking.</li>
</ol>

<p>PS: It is quite hard to make certain that this question has not already been asked in the jungle of questions about memory leaks with closures.</p>

<p>The question I pose to you all is how do I go about coding a function that will take a string, ""one which may have spaces"", refer to the function that removes spaces, giving something like ""onewhichmayhavespaces"", and then break it up amd calculate it into the number bijection(""o"") + bijection(""n"") + bijection(""e"") +...+ bijection(""s"") + bijection(""p"") + bijection(""a"") + bijection(""c"") + bijection(""e"") + bijection(""s"").
<p> in the grand scheme of this program, I would take the output of this function I can't make, and plug it and some other information into the label function.

"<p>I am working on a data streaming application and I am investigating the possibility of using Apache Flink for this project. The main reason for this is that it supports nice high-level streaming constructs, very similar to Java 8's Stream API. </p>

<p>I will be receiving events which correspond to a specific record in a database, and I want to be able to process these events (coming from a message broker such as RabbitMQ or Kafka) and eventually update the records in the database and push the processed/transformed events to another sink (probably another message broker).</p>

<p>Events related to a specific record will ideally need to be processed in FIFO ordering (although there will be a timestamp which helps detect out of order events too), but events related to different records can be processed in parallel. I was planning to use the <code>keyBy()</code> construct to partition the stream by record. </p>

<p>The processing that needs to be done depends on the current information in the database about the record. However, I am unable to find an example or recommended approach to query a database for such records to enrich the event that it is being processed with the additional information I need to process it. </p>

<p>The pipeline I have in mind is as follows:</p>

<p>-> keyBy() on the id received -> retrieve the record from the database corresponding to the id -> perform processing steps on the record -> push the processed event to an external queue and update the database record </p>

<p>The database record will need to be updated because another application will be querying the data. </p>

<p>There might be additional optimisations one could do after this pipeline is achieved. For example one could cache the (updated) record in a managed state so that the next event on the same record will not need another database query. However, if the application does not know about a specific record it will need to retrieve it from the database. </p>

How can I implement single-loop iteration over a hierarchy of different objects?

*(I have used for-loops but these represent a different areas of a grid -- I can barely follow all the values used for positioning. Using a single loop would drastically simplify things.)*

This hierarchy of objects is what I have....

    class Hierarchical < PT extends Hierarchical<?,?,?>,T,CT extends Hierarchical< ?, ?, ? >>{
		ObservableList< Hierarchical > children;  //Zero or more objects..
    }

    class Seed   extends Hierarchical { /* never has children-objects */ }
    class Tree   extends Hierarchical { ... }
    class Planet extends Hierarchical { ... }

...and this is what I want to do:

    Planet p = new Planet(); //trees/seeds are instantiated internally.
    Iterator< ? > itr = p.getChildren().iterator();
    while ( itr.hasNext() ) {
		Object obj = itr.next();
		if ( obj instanceof Aobject ){ /* cast to Aobject & do stuff */ }
		if ( obj instanceof Bobject ){ /* cast to Bobject & do stuff */ }
		if ( obj instanceof Cobject ){ /* cast to Cobject & do stuff */ }
    }


Clearly the answer lies in `Iterator< ? > itr = p.getChildren().iterator();
` but how can it be implemented? It would seem that every level of the hierarchy would need to keep a position of it's children in the event its children start looping through their children. It's been far too long, I'm not familiar with design-patterns & java's collections anymore.  :(

"<p>we are using Gitlab 8.10.1 with many groups and projects. Many of the projects happen to be forks of other projects.
Our problem is that whenever somebody opens a merge request for a project the default target branch is NOT the default branch of the project but from one very specific other project. Is there a way to override this setting somehow?
Just to make it clear, I know how to set the default branch of a project and those settings appear to be correct, however gitlab doesn't seem to use them when creating merge requests.
This issue is very annoying and has led to weird situations when people didn't pay attention and made merge requests with a completely different ""master"" as target.</p>

"<p>We are exposing a stateless Owin WebAPI hosted on all nodes in our service fabric cluster (instance count -1) on Azure. The WebAPI is meant for public consumption and should be highly available even in the face of upgrades to the internal services and the WebAPI itself. We have the Azure loadbalancer (LB) in front of the cluster that probes the cluster on port 80 using a TCP probe every 5 sec in order to determine which nodes can receive http traffic.</p>

<p>We are experiencing issues when upgrading the WebAPI, namely that the LB directs to a node that is upgrading but is not yet registered as offline by the probe. Service Fabric does not coordinate the upgrade process with the LB so there are no chance (and no API on the Azure LB) to take the node out of rotation while upgrading.</p>

"<p>I thought this would be a pretty straightforward task and there is quite a bit of documentation out there but I've had zero luck with any of it and am assuming that it is pretty much all out of date.</p>

<p>I have .NET Core MVC 6 Web App that I've been developing for a while and need to set up a WebJob for it on Azure. I want to deploy this alongside the app using the continuous deployment system Azure provides that the app is already using. According to Kudu docs it's possible:</p>

<p><a href=""https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Web-Jobs#deploying-net-console-webjobs-alongside-an-aspnet-application"">https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Web-Jobs#deploying-net-console-webjobs-alongside-an-aspnet-application</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This works both when deploying directly from Visual Studio
  (WebDeploy), or via git.</p>

<p>I have the latest version of Visual Studio 2015, .NET Core 1.0.0 &amp; Tools and the Azure SDK.</p>

<p>First thing that becomes apparent is that I do not have the scaffolding options as shown in the screenshots on the Azure docs and after failing to find any missing dependencies I resorted to trying to set it up manually as described.</p>

<p>Even after putting the required files in the locations specified (<code>webjobs-list.json</code> and <code>webjob-publish-settings.json</code>) and configuring them for my project, and adding <code>Microsoft.Web.WebJobs.Publish</code> to the WebJob project, Kudu does not find the WebJob via the continuous deployment system.</p>

    member acc.status = status

<p>Having done a lot of OO before starting to learn F# this one got me wondering. How do more experienced F# developers use classes? To make answering this question more simple, here are my main concerns about classes/types in F#:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is the use of classes in a typical OO fashion discouraged in F#?</li>
<li>Are immutable classes preferred? ( I found them to be confusing in the above example)</li>
<li>What is the preferred way to access/alter class data in F#? (Class member functions and get/set or free functions which allow piping? What about static members to allow piping and providing the functions with a fitting namespace?)</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm sorry if the question is vague. I don't want to develop bad coding habits in my functional code and i need a starting point on what good practices are.</p>

"I'm working on a data analysis program to be executed in Java. When I start the program, a dialog prompts the user to input a string of letters. The program then searches a specified directory for all files whose titles contains that string.

How would I get started writing the search portion of this program? What would be the ideal method for storing the titles for use in later functions, should I use string arrays?",LQ
"I have a dataset of ~3 milion chess games (existing columns include names of players, date, result and tournament name). **I want to use Random Forest to predict results of chess games.**  

To this end, I want to do some **feature engineering**. There are several variables that I believe would be strong predictors, e.g. players' results so far in the tournament, number of games 90 days prior to the game. 

Unfortunately, my queries were rather... slow (I wrote 14 and tested them on a smaller dataset, not even 1 was completed in 8 days). Below is a simplified version, which I put on 2 hours ago and still have no results.

    SELECT sum(result) INTO temp FROM chess_data2 t1 WHERE id IN
    (SELECT t2.id FROM chess_data2 t2 WHERE t1.tournament = t2.tournament 
    AND t1.namew=t2.namew)

My questions:  
1.**Can I make this work faster in SQL** (faster as in, complete 14 similar queries in less than 10 days on my i7-4710HQ and 12gb of RAM?). Perhaps by explicitly sorting it beforehand?  
2.**Any other way I could achieve my goal faster?** I tried to naively code this using loops in python and the performance was even worse, but I heard C is better for this stuff... but just how much better?
  
I use python 3.5 for estimation and psycopg2 to deal with SQL.

"Hello Guys I am writing a game and I need to switch activities when the game is over my problem is I have a gameLogic java class Which extends to Activity it is not an main activity class. So I have a gameover method in GameLogic Class which returns boolean. IF it returns false it has to switch to the second Activity but it doesnt. It returns null.pointer.exception Here Are thecodes :


public void gameOver(GameData data){

        if(!intersect(data)){

            Intent intent = new Intent(GameLogic.this , SecondActivity.class);
            startActivity(intent);

        }

and I am calling this method in GameData class in OnDraw method because OnDraw Method always has to control if it is gameover or not 

protected void onDraw(Canvas canvas){
.........
....
......
.....
............
logic.gameOver(this);

}

The problem is I am trying to match the delimiter, either DL or ID, sometimes. It might be in the string a second time (sometimes not). There is a standard, but some of the states weren't/aren't compliant 100%. I want to match whichever of DL|ID that matched previously, 0|1 times. The problem is if I add ? to accomplish this it stops being greedy and prefers 0 times to 1. I'm stumped, am I missing something basic with how '?' operates?

This:
/(ANSI|AAMVA) (\d{6})(\d{2})(\d{2})(\d{0,2})((?:DL)|(?:ID))+(.*?)\g{-2}?([^""]+)/

ignores the second DL|ID (note the change \g{-2}+ to \g{-2}?) when I would expect it to be greedy and match up to 1 times (* gives same result as ?).

This could be a valid version stream that I would need to match too:
{""name"":""SC"",""hostname"":""tukwila"",""pid"":11,""level"":30,""msg"":""@\n\nANSI 6334290212DL0038919988DAQ3572928\nDAASMITH, JOHN DOE\nDAG\nDAL4389 NE 47TH AVE\nDAIASHLAND\nDAJOR\nDAK97555      \nDARC   \nDASD         \nDATM     \nDAU504\nDAW180\nDBA12201212\nDBB19780303\n"",""time"":""2016-04-02T01:09:07.113Z"",""v"":0}

"<p>I have some code that maps strongly-typed business objects into anonymous types, which are then serialized into JSON and exposed via an API.</p>

<p>After restructuring my solution into separate projects, some of my tests started to fail. I've done a bit of digging and it turns out that <code>Object.Equals</code> behaves differently on anonymous types that are returned by code from a different assembly - and I'm not sure why, or what I can do to work around it.</p>

<p>There's full repro code at <a href=""https://github.com/dylanbeattie/AnonymousTypeEquality"">https://github.com/dylanbeattie/AnonymousTypeEquality</a> but the bit that's actually breaking is below. This code is in the Tests project:</p>

<pre><code>[TestFixture]
public class Tests {
    [Test]
    public void BothInline() {
        var a = new { name = ""test"", value = 123 };
        var b = new { name = ""test"", value = 123 };
        Assert.That(Object.Equals(a,b)); // passes
    }

    [Test]
    public void FromLocalMethod() {
        var a = new { name = ""test"", value = 123 };
        var b = MakeObject(""test"", 123);
        Assert.That(Object.Equals(a, b)); // passes
    }

    [Test]
    public void FromOtherNamespace() {
        var a = new { name = ""test"", value = 123 };
        var b = OtherNamespaceClass.MakeObject(""test"", 123);
        Assert.That(Object.Equals(a, b)); // passes
    }


    [Test]
    public void FromOtherClass() {
        var a = new { name = ""test"", value = 123 };
        var b = OtherClass.MakeObject(""test"", 123);

        /* This is the test that fails, and I cannot work out why */
        Assert.That(Object.Equals(a, b));
    }

    private object MakeObject(string name, int value) {
        return new { name, value };
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>and then there is a separate class library in the solution containing only this:</p>

<pre><code>namespace OtherClasses {
  public static class OtherClass {
    public static object MakeObject(string name, int value) {
      return new { name, value };
    }
  }  
}
</code></pre>

<p>According to <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-GB/library/bb397696.aspx"">MSDN</a>, ""two instances of the <strong>same anonymous type</strong> are equal only if all their properties are equal."" (my emphasis) - so what controls whether two instances are of the <strong>same</strong> anonymous type for comparison purposes? My two instances have equal hash codes, and both appear to be <code>&lt;>f__AnonymousType0`2[System.String,System.Int32]</code> - but I'm guessing that equality for anonymous types must take the fully qualified type name into account and therefore moving code into a different assembly can break things. Anyone got a definitive source / link on exactly how this is implemented? </p>

"<p>I'm using Visual Studio 2015 Pro and working with a Git repo.  Let's say I did a pull or applied stashed changes or did something that causes my branch to become in conflict.  For example, in this case I just applied a stash:</p>

<p>Two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>I <em>believe</em> if I were to do a <em>Pull</em> using Visual Studio, it would detect the conflicts that then run the merge tool.  I haven't tried this yet, but I know it works that way for TFS.  However, I'd like to know if I can use <em>git pull</em> from the command line and then use Visual Studio to resolve conflicts.</li>
<li><code>git config --global merge.tool</code> is already <code>vsdiffmerge</code> so if I were to run <code>git mergetool</code> from the command line, it would <em>then</em> use Visual Studio to merge.  However, doing this spawns a whole new instance of Visual Studio which is slow and annoying, and doesn't let me work in the context of the rest of my project.</li>

"Given a set of elements (expressed in a row vector `Vi`) I extracted the maximum values into another (row) vector (named 'ki') using `[ki] = find(Vi==max(max(Vi)))`.

    ri=rand(1)
    
    for j=1:length(ki)

                    }

Built both xml files with the same root element.

My question is, since the xmlReader.Create function accepts only 1 stream reader
How in the name of *, do i read with the xml reader from 2 xmls??

Do I combine 2 streams into 1 and read from 1st bit to the last 1, if so, how?

"<p>In django, for class-based view like <code>ListView</code> and <code>DetailView</code>, methods like <code>get()</code> or <code>post()</code> or other functions defined by developer take parameters include <code>self</code> and <code>request</code>. I learnt that in <code>self</code> these is actually a <code>self.request</code> field, so wha's the difference between <code>self.request</code> and <code>request</code>? </p>

<p>Example, this is the function in a class based view and used to handle user's login requirement:</p>

<pre><code>def login(self, request):
    name = request.POST['name']
    pwd = request.POST['password']
    user = authenticate(username=name, password=pwd)

    if user is not None:
        request.session.set_expiry(0)
        login(request, user)
        log_message = 'Login successfully.'
    else:
        log_message = 'Fail to login.'

    return HttpResponseRedirect(reverse('blog:testindex'))
</code></pre>

<p>This is the function used to handle user's register:</p>

<pre><code>def register(self, request):
    user_name = self.request.POST['username']
    firstname = self.request.POST['firstname']
    lastname = self.request.POST['lastname']
    pwd = self.request.POST['password']
    e_mail = self.request.POST['email']
    user = User.objects.create(username=user_name, first_name=firstname, last_name=lastname, email=e_mail)
    user.set_password(pwd)
    try:
        user.save()
        user = authenticate(username=user_name, password=pwd)
        login(self.request, user)
    except Exception:
        pass
    else:
        return HttpResponseRedirect(reverse('blog:testindex'))

    }
 &lt;/MyContainer&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, <code>&lt;MyModal /&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;MyModalContent /&gt;</code> now need to be concerned with props that have nothing to do with it, seeing as a modal should be able to be re-used and only be concerned with stylistic qualities of a modal. </p>

<p>At first the above seemed great but once I got to 100+ components it all felt very tangled, and I found the complexity of these top-level container components to be too high for my liking, seeing as most of them (in the app I'm working on) depend on responses from 3+ API requests.</p>

<p>Then I decided to try multiple containers:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>pro:</strong> Completely removes the need to forward props. It still makes sense to do it in some cases, but it's a lot more flexible.</li>
<li><strong>pro:</strong> Way easier to refactor. I'm surprised at how I can significantly move around and refactor components without anything breaking, whereas in the other pattern things broke a lot.</li>
<li><strong>pro:</strong> The complexity of each container component is much less. My <code>mapStateToProps</code> and <code>mapDispatchToProps</code> is more specific to the purpose of the component it's in.</li>
<li><strong>con:</strong> Any component that depends on async stuff will always need to handle <code>isFetching</code> state in itself. This adds complexity that is not necessary in the pattern where its handled in a single container component.</li>
</ul>

<p>So the main dilemma is that if I use <strong>one container</strong>, I get this un-necessary complexity in components between the root container and the leaf components. If I use <strong>multiple containers</strong>, I get more complexity in the leaf components, and end up with buttons that need to worry about <code>isFetching</code>  even though a button should not be concerned about that.</p>

<p>I'd like to know if anyone has found a way to avoid both cons, and if so, what is the ""rule of thumb"" you follow to avoid this?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

"<p>I'm new to Git, so feel free to treat me like a newbie.</p>

<p>Our workflow is such.  We have a branch called <code>dev</code> which I can reach at <code>origin/dev</code>.  When we do changes, we create a branch off dev:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>git checkout -b FixForBug origin/dev</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now I have a branch called <code>FixForBug</code> which is tracking (I think that's the right word) <code>origin/dev</code>.  Thus, if I do a <code>git pull</code> it'll bring in new changes from <code>origin/dev</code> which is great.  Now, when I'm finished with my fix, I push to a remote branch called the same thing.</p>

<p>First I pull down any changes from <code>origin/dev</code> and do a rebase:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>git pull --rebase</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then I push the changes to a remote branch of the same name:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>git push origin FixForBug</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, there's a branch on the remote server and I can create a pull request for that change to be approved and merged back in to the dev branch.  I don't <em>ever</em> push anything to <code>origin/dev</code> myself.  I'm guessing this is as pretty common workflow.</p>

<p>The first time I do a <code>git push</code>, it works fine and creates the remote branch.  However, if I push a <em>second</em> time (let's say during code-review, someone points out a problem), I get the following error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>error: failed to push some refs to
  '<a href=""https://github.limeade.info/Limeade/product.git"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://github.limeade.info/Limeade/product.git</a>' hint: Updates were
  rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind hint: its
  remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g. hint: 'git pull
  ...') before pushing again. hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards'
  in 'git push --help' for details.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, if I do a <code>git status</code> it says I'm ahead of <code>origin/dev</code> by 1 commit (which makes sense) and if I follow the hint and run <code>git pull</code>, it says everything is up to date.  I <em>think</em> this is because I'm pushing to a different branch than my upstream branch.  I can fix this issue by running:</p>

<p><code>git push -f origin FixForBug</code></p>

<p>In that case, it'll push the changes to the remote branch, saying <em>(forced update)</em> and everything <em>appears</em> to be good on the remote branch.</p>

<p><strong>My Questions:</strong></p>

<p>Why is <code>-f</code> required in this scenario?  Usually when you're <em>forcing</em> something, it's because you were doing something wrong or at least against standard practice.  Am I ok doing this, or will it mess up something in the remote branch or create a hassle for whoever has to eventually merge my stuff into dev?</p>

<pre><code>    var ffi = require('ffi');   
    var intPtr = ref.refType('long');
    var user32 = new ffi.Library('user32', {
        'FindWindowA': ['long', [ 'string', 'string']],
        'SetForegroundWindow': ['bool', ['long']],
        'BringWindowToTop': ['bool', ['long']],
    });

    var winToSetOnTop = user32.FindWindowA(null,""calculator"")
    var res = user32.ShowWindow(winToSetOnTop, 9);
    res = user32.SetForegroundWindow(winToSetOnTop);
    res = user32.BringWindowToTop(winToSetOnTop);   
</code></pre>

<p>This combination of commands seems to work most consistently of the ones I have tried, but it does not work all the time.  If the window I want to switch focus to is minimized it will always pop to the top.  If the window is not minimized, but just behind another window, it will only be shown intermittently.  I am not sure how to consistently to get a running windows application to always move to the top of the order, even if it is currently minimized.</p>

"<p>I have a Function App with 3 functions, one of them timer-triggered every 2 minutes. I observed that after a while, the function stops being triggered, but restarts when I go to the portal.</p>

"I have the following setup:

Some files are dynamically generated dependent on some (only a few) session parameters. Since they have not a great diversity, i allow caching in proxys/browsers. The files get an etag on their way, and the reaction of the whole web application at first glance seems correct: Files served in correct dependence from session situations, traffic saved.

And then this erroneous behavior:

But at closer inspection, i found that in his answer in case of a 304 for those dynamically generated files, apache wrongly sends a ""Connection: close"" Header instead of the normally sent ""Connection: KeepAlive"". What he should do is: Do not do that shit.

I cannot find any point where to pinpoint the cause of this behavior: Nowhere in the apache config files is anything written except one single line in one single file where it is instructed to send a keepalive - which it does - as long as it does not send a 304 response for a dynamically generated file. Nowhere in PHP do i instruct that guy to send anything other than keepalives (and the latter only to try to counter its closing shit).

The apache does not do this shit when it serves ""normal"" (non-dynamic) files (with 304 answers). So in some way i assume that maybe the PHP kernel is the one who interferes here without permission or being asked. But then, an added ""Header set Connection 'Keep-Alive'"" in the apache config, which i too added to counter this closing shit, does not work, too. Normally, when you put such a header set rule (not of ""early"" type) in the apache config, this rules takes action AFTER finalization of any subordered work on the requested document (thus AFTER finalization of the PHP output). But in my case, nothing happens - well: in case of a 304 response. In all other cases, everything works normal and correct.

Since there do some other files go over the line at a page request, i would appreciate to get the apache rid of those connection-closures.

Is there anybody who has an idea what to do with this behavior?

"My code returns a data set, however I do not believe they are accurate and I'm a bit lost working with sub queries. Can someone look over my code. The problem I'm trying to solve is from advanced question from TSQL-2012 book. The question tells me: 

Get the order ID, order date, customer ID, and company name for all orders that contain at least one item from the Condiments category.  Use the category name in your query.

This is my code:

    SELECT o.orderid, o.orderdate, o.custid, c.companyname
    FROM Sales.Orders AS o
         JOIN Sales.OrderDetails AS od
         ON o.orderid = od.orderid
         JOIN Sales.Customers AS c
         ON o.custid = c.custid
         WHERE qty > 1
        (SELECT categoryname FROM
            Production.Categories    
            WHERE categoryname = N'Condiments');

My results:

    orderid	   orderdate	        custid	companyname

I'm wracking my head as this must be a correlated query because the category Table shares no relationship with Orders or customers. Much appreciated for all learning/teaching responses.

"<p>I've developed a pretty simple web app using entity framework code first. I realized after hours of frustration that even though localdb is SQL Server Express it is actually not meant to be used with production when using 'publish' (the publish wizard). FYI I'm using EF 6.1.3, SQL Server 2014, VS 2013, and IIS 7.</p>

<p>If I understand correctly, when you click publish with localdb, all you're really doing is copying your localdb database to your IIS 7 server. I couldn't figure out why that when I updated my lodaldb database through VS migrations that my production server database wasn't being updated. I understand (and believe now) that it's actually two different instances of localdb, and hence not the same data.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>How do I manage this new database using EF? For instance, suppose I want to add a new column. First I add it to my localdb, do some testing, and do the migration using Add-Migration blah then Update-Database... Do I then have to generate a SQL script using VS and then manually run that on the production DB server?</p></li>
<li><p>I know this isn't great, but instead of using local DB with entity framework, can I just attach EF to a real staging SQL Server database (a test one) and skip all this localdb bull****? Then could I manage it using code-first migrations and keep everything in sync?</p></li>
<li><p>Am I supposed to use an Initializer? I've read conflicting reports about whether to use these or not for a production db (like this one)</p>

"<p>The claim on the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap#Insert"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia page for binary heaps</a> is that insertion is O(log <em>n</em>) in the worst case, but O(1) on average:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The number of operations required depends only on the number of levels the new element must rise to satisfy the heap property, thus the insertion operation has a worst-case time complexity of O(log <em>n</em>) but an average-case complexity of O(1).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href=""http://wcipeg.com/wiki/Binary_heap#Insertion_2"" rel=""noreferrer"">linked page</a> attempts to justify this as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, on average, the newly inserted element does not travel very far up the tree. In particular, assuming a uniform distribution of keys, it has a one-half chance of being greater than its parent; it has a one-half chance of being greater than its grandparent given that it is greater than its parent; it has a one-half chance of being greater than its great-grandparent given that it is greater than its parent, and so on [...] so that in the average case insertion takes constant time</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is surely nonsense, though? It seems to me that if the tree were randomly ordered then there would be a 50/50 chance that a new element was greater than its parent; but that since, roughly speaking, the large elements sink to the bottom, the chances are much less than 50/50 as the heap grows.</p>

<pre><code>constexpr auto f() { return S{}, void(); }

Neither the following definition works (for obvious reasons):</p>

<pre><code>constexpr int operator,(S, void) { return 42; }

<p>Is there any way to overload the comma operator so as to deal with <code>S{}, void()</code>?<br>
Isn't it otherwise a lack in the standard, for it allows to use the comma operator that way, but doesn't give you the chance to overload the same operator (even if <a href=""http://eel.is/c++draft/over.oper#6"">the standard mentions that overloaded functions involving <code>S</code> are allowed</a>)?</p>

"<p>One of the touted features of the ART runtime in Android 5.0+ is heap compaction, to reduce heap fragmentation. A fragmented heap can get <code>OutOfMemoryErrors</code> a lot easier, as there may not be a single contiguous free block of memory big enough for your needs, even if the heap overall has enough free space.</p>

<p>I understand that this occurs when the app moves to the background, based on Google conference presentations and the like. However, the only statement that I can find on it in <a href=""https://developer.android.com/studio/profile/investigate-ram.html#LogMessages"" rel=""noreferrer"">the documentation</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Homogeneous space compaction is free-list space to free-list space compaction which usually occurs when an app is moved to a pause imperceptible process state. The main reasons for doing this are reducing RAM usage and defragmenting the heap. </p>

"<p>I recently inherited an application that uses PostgreSQL and I have been troubleshooting issues relating to saving records in the database.</p>

<p>I know that PostgreSQL allows me to record the transaction ID in the log by including the special value of <code>%x</code> in the <code>log_line_prefix</code>. What I noticed, however, is that the first statement that occurs within a transaction always gets logged with a zero.</p>

<p>If I perform the following operations in psql,</p>

<pre><code>begin;
insert into numbers (1);
insert into numbers (2);
commit;
</code></pre>

<p>the query log will contain the following entries:</p>

<pre><code>2016-09-20 03:07:40 UTC 0 LOG:  statement: begin;
2016-09-20 03:07:53 UTC 0 LOG:  statement: insert into numbers values (1);
2016-09-20 03:07:58 UTC 689 LOG:  statement: insert into numbers values (2);
2016-09-20 03:08:03 UTC 689 LOG:  statement: commit;
</code></pre>

<p>My log format is <code>%t %x</code> and as you can see, the transaction ID for the first insert statement is 0, but it changes to 689 when I execute the second insert.</p>

<p>Can anyone explain why after starting a transaction PostgreSQL doesn't log the right transaction ID on the first statement? Or if I'm just doing this wrong, is there a more reliable way of identifying which queries were part of a single transaction by looking at the log file?</p>

<p>In my understanding, it should print <code>1</code>. However, when built with GCC 5.4.0 or GCC 6.2.0, <code>a.f(1)</code> emits a segmentation fault, because the captured <code>this</code> pointer is null.</p>

<p>The following alternatives work as I expected:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Using constructor initializer list:</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;typename T&gt;
struct B {
    B() : f([this](T v) { x = v; }) {}
    T x = 0;
    std::function&lt;void(T)&gt; f;
};
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Without template:</p>

<pre><code>struct C {
    int x = 0;
    std::function&lt;void(int)&gt; f = [this](int v) { x = v; };
};
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>Also, when built with Clang 3.8.0, all three versions behave as I expect, which doesn't mean it is not UB.</p>

"Alright well,

As the title suggests, I'm having a problem with c++ haha.

Specifically, I am just trying to start out and well I am having little to no luck.

So far I have downloaded and tried two compilers (and would like to make this work as I would really like to use an open source software).

I've tried to use:

1) Clang-  I've tried to install it, and it failed to install.

I got two error messages when I tried that: ""Failed to find MSBuild toolsets directory."" 

AND

""Failed to open files while installing""


Then I tried to Install Dev C++ and had a bit more luck, yet still ran into problems.

I just couldnt get the ""Hello World"" file to compile and run.

I got the following error messages with that:

     [linker error] undefined reference to '__dyn_tls_init_callback'

      [linker error] undefined reference to '__cpu_features_init'

       [linker error] undefined reference to '__setargv'

Any help would be greatly appreciated!



P.S This is a bit of side note/rant, but why is this not just a straightforward process, You know like executing what the book tells me to do, and expecting it to work right? 


Anyhow for your reference I am using ""SamsTeachYourself C++ in One Hour a Day""

P.S Another side note, don't know why these technical books just can't communicate this stuff into plain english!

"<p>According to the documentation of Data in Swift 3, there is an initializer that I can use to create a Data from UnsafeRawPointer. What I need actually is the opposite. I have a Data, and I want to create a UnsafeRawPointer that points to the bytes of the Data. Here's what I'm doing right now:</p>

<pre><code>1. let data = &lt;from some where&gt;
2. let unsafePointer = UnsafeMutablePointer&lt;UInt8&gt;.allocate(capacity: data.count)
3. unsafePointer.initialize(to: 0, count: data.count) // is this necessary?
4. data.copyBytes(to: unsafePointer, count: data.count)
5. let unsafeRawPointer = unsafePointer.deinitialize() // this is of the type UnsafeMutalbleRawPointer, and I can use it where UnsafeRawPointer is needed.
</code></pre>

<p>I verified that this code works in Xcode Playground. The code even works without the line number 3. I'm not sure what is the difference with or without the line. Anyway, my question is, am I doing right for what I want? Is there a simpler way to do it?</p>

I want to implement a very long boolean array (as a binary genome) and access some intervals to check if that interval is all true or not, and in addition i want to change some intervals value,

for example i can do this:

    boolean binaryGenome[10000000]={false};

and access this way:

    inline bool checkBinGenome(long long start , long long end){
      for(long long i = start; i < end+1 ; i++)
        if(binaryGenome[i] == false)
            return false;
      return true;
    }
    inline void changeBinGenome(long long start , long long end){
      for(long long i = start; i < end+1 ; i++)
        binaryGenome[i] = true;
    }

Or i can use alternatives for example using `<vector>` but it will use more memory for pointers and memory is a bottleneck for me

As i want to access array elements randomly, what is the fastest implementation?

"<p>I was attempting to chain two async functions together, because the first had a conditional return parameter that caused the second to either run, or exit the module. However, I've found odd behavior I can't find in the specs.</p>

    //promise.all([chained methods here])
    let exit = false;
    if (someCondition) exit = true;

<p>This is a bastardized snippet of my code (you can see the full scope <a href=""https://github.com/RUJodan/SourceUndead/blob/master/routes/lobby.js#L53"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>), that simply checks if a player if already in a lobby, but that's irrelevant.</p>

<p>Next we have this async function.</p>

<pre><code>async function countPlayer() {

<p>I tried to do</p>

<pre><code>const inLobby = await isInLobby();
</code></pre>

<p>This I hoped would await to results, so I can use <code>inLobby</code> to conditionally run <code>countPlayer</code>, however I received a typeerror with no specific details.</p>

<p>Why can't you <code>await</code> an <code>async</code> function outside of the scope of the function? I know it's a sugar promise, so it must be chained to <code>then</code> but why is it that in <code>countPlayer</code> I can await another promise, but outside, I can't <code>await</code> <code>isInLobby</code>?</p>

"<p>I'm trying to do a shared element transition between two activities.</p>

<p>The first activity has a circle imageview and the second activity has a rectangular imageview. I just want the circle to transition from the first activity to the second activity where it becomes a square and back to the circle when I press back.</p>

<p>I find that the transition is not so neat - in the animation below, you can see that the rectangular imageview seem to reduce in size until it matches the size of the circle. The square imageview appears for a split second and and then the circle appears. I want to get rid of the square imageview so that the circle becomes the end point of the transition. </p>

<p>Anyone know how this is done?
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZY7mm.gif"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZY7mm.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I have create a small test repo that you can download here: <a href=""https://github.com/Winghin2517/TransitionTest"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://github.com/Winghin2517/TransitionTest</a></p>

<p>The code for my first activity - the imageview sits within the <code>MainFragment</code> of my first activity:</p>

<pre><code>public class MainFragment extends android.support.v4.app.Fragment {

    @Override
    public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container,
                             Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        View view = inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_view, container,false);
        final ImageView dot = (ImageView) view.findViewById(R.id.image_circle);
        Picasso.with(getContext()).load(R.drawable.snow).transform(new PureCircleTransformation()).into(dot);
        dot.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onClick(View view) {
                Intent i = new Intent(getContext(), SecondActivity.class);
                View sharedView = dot;
                String transitionName = getString(R.string.blue_name);
                ActivityOptionsCompat transitionActivityOptions = ActivityOptionsCompat.makeSceneTransitionAnimation(getActivity(), sharedView, transitionName);
                startActivity(i, transitionActivityOptions.toBundle());
            }
        });
        return view;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is my second activity which contains the rectangular imageview:</p>

<pre><code>public class SecondActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    ImageView backdrop;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_second);
        backdrop = (ImageView) findViewById(R.id.picture);
        backdrop.setBackground(ContextCompat.getDrawable(this, R.drawable.snow));
    }

    @Override
    public void onBackPressed() {
        supportFinishAfterTransition();
        super.onBackPressed();

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is the PureCircleTransformation class that I pass into Picasso to generate the circle:</p>

<pre><code>package test.com.transitiontest;

import android.graphics.Bitmap;
import android.graphics.BitmapShader;
import android.graphics.Canvas;
import android.graphics.Paint;

import com.squareup.picasso.Transformation;

public class PureCircleTransformation implements Transformation {

    private static final int STROKE_WIDTH = 6;

    @Override
    public Bitmap transform(Bitmap source) {
        int size = Math.min(source.getWidth(), source.getHeight());

        int x = (source.getWidth() - size) / 2;
        int y = (source.getHeight() - size) / 2;

        Bitmap squaredBitmap = Bitmap.createBitmap(source, x, y, size, size);
        if (squaredBitmap != source) {
            source.recycle();
        }

        Bitmap bitmap = Bitmap.createBitmap(size, size, source.getConfig());

        Canvas canvas = new Canvas(bitmap);

        Paint avatarPaint = new Paint();
        BitmapShader shader = new BitmapShader(squaredBitmap, BitmapShader.TileMode.CLAMP, BitmapShader.TileMode.CLAMP);
        avatarPaint.setShader(shader);

        float r = size / 2f;
        canvas.drawCircle(r, r, r, avatarPaint);

        squaredBitmap.recycle();
        return bitmap;
    }

    @Override
    public String key() {
        return ""circleTransformation()"";
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I do understand that in my first activity, the circle is just 'cut' out by applying the Picasso transformation class and that the imageview is just a square layout cut out so that it appears as a circle. Maybe this is the reason why the animation looks like this as I'm transitioning from a rectangular to a square, but I really want the the transition to go from the rectangular to a circle.</p>

<p>I think there is a way to do this. In the whatsapp app, I can see the effect but I just cannot seem to figure out how they managed to do it - If you click on the profile picture of your friends on whatsapp, the app expands the circle imageview to a square. Clicking back will return the square to the circle.</p>

"<p>My computer has 64 bit processor and when I look for <code>sizeof(int)</code>, <code>sizeof(long)</code>, and <code>sizeof(long long)</code>, it turns out that <strong>int</strong> and <strong>long</strong> are 32 bits, and <strong>long long</strong> is 64 bit. I researched the reason, and it appears that popular assumption telling that <strong>int</strong> in C++ fits machine's word size is wrong. As I understood it is up to compiler to define what will be the size, and mine is Mingw-w64. The reason for my research was understanding that if the usage of types smaller than word size is beneficial for speed(for instance, <strong><em>short</strong> vs <strong>int</em></strong>) or if it has negative effect. In 32 bit system, one popular opinion is: due to the fact that word size is <strong>int</strong>, <strong>short</strong> will be converted into <strong>int</strong> and it would cause additional bit shifts and etc, thus leading to worse performance. Opposing opinion is that there will be benefit in cache level(I didn't go deep into it), and using <strong>short</strong> would be usefull for virtual memory economy. So, in addition to confusion between this dilemma, I also face another problem. My system is 64 bit, and it doesn't matter if I use <strong>int</strong> or <strong>short</strong> , it still will be less than the word size, and I start thinking that wouldn't it be efficient to use 64 bit <strong>long long</strong> because it is at the level the system is designed to. Also I read that there is another constraint, which is library(ILP64, LP64) of OS that defines the type sizes. In ILP64 default <strong>int</strong> is 64 bit in contrast to LP64, would it speed up the program if I use OS with ILP64 support? Once I started to ask which type should I use for speeding up my C++ program,  I faced more deep topics in which I have no expertise and some explanations seems to contradict to each other. Can you please explain:</p>

<p>1) If it is best  practice to use <strong>long long</strong> in x64 for achieving maximum performance even for for 1-4 byte data?</p>

<p>2) Trade-off in using a type less than word size(memory win vs additional operations)</p>

<p>3) Does a x64 computer where word&amp;int size is 64 bits, has possibility of processing a short, using 16 bit word size by using so called backward compatibility? Or it must put the 16bit file into 64 bit file, and the fact that it can be done defines the system as backward compatible. </p>

<p>4) Can we force the compiler to make the <strong>int</strong> 64 bit?</p>

<p>5) How to incorporate ILP64 into PC that uses LP64?</p>

<p>6) What are possible problems of using code adapted to above issues with other compilers, OS's, and architectures(32 bit processor)?</p>

All the tuples I've seen passed to <code>bbox_to_anchor</code> have 2 elements in it, but this one has 4. What does each element mean if the tuple passed has 4 elements?

I was looking at it in the <code>pyplot.legend</code> <a href=""http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.legend"" rel=""noreferrer"">docs</a>, and it said something about <code>bbox_transform</code> coordinates. So I looked around and found <code>matplotlib.transforms.Bbox</code> with a <a href=""http://matplotlib.org/devel/transformations.html#matplotlib.transforms.Bbox"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>static from_bounds(x0, y0, width, height)</code></a>.

I was guessing the setup for the 4-tuple parameter was based on this <code>from_bounds</code>.

It seemed to make sense, but when I tried only changing <code>.102</code> to something like <code>0.9</code>, the legend didn't change.

"<p><a href=""https://github.com/angular/angular-cli#proxy-to-backend"">https://github.com/angular/angular-cli#proxy-to-backend</a> here is an instruction how to do proxying to backend. I did everything step by step and still requests aren't proxied.</p>

<p>8080 - my Express backend
4200 - my Angular2 frontend</p>

<p>In Angular2 project I have file <code>proxy.cons.json</code> with content like this:</p>

<pre><code>{
  ""/api"": {
    ""target"": ""http://localhost:8080"",
    ""secure"": false
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In Angular2 package.json I changed <code>start</code> procedure to <code>""start"": ""ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json""</code></p>

<p>When I type inside commander <code>npm start</code> then at the start I can see <code>Proxy created: /api -&gt; http://localhost:8080</code>. Well, so far is good I guess.</p>

<p>I'm trying to send a request (Angular2)</p>

<pre><code>  constructor(private http: Http) {
    this.getAnswer();
  }

  getAnswer(): any {
    return this.http.get(""/api/hello"")
      .subscribe(response =&gt; {
        console.log(response);
      })
  }
</code></pre>

<p>I'm getting an error that <code>http://localhost:4200/api/hello 404 (Not Found)</code>. As we can see, nothing has been proxied. Why? Did I do something wrong?</p>

<p>To be clear. When I go manually to <code>http://localhost:8080/hello</code>, all works fine. There is nothing to look for in backend side.</p>

"  So It had seemed that my program was working properly, but I made some adjustments and came back and the whole thing stopped working. I sussed out what are usually the common culprits (brackets, file io, etc.). I found if(string.contains(string)) would continually run, ie: always true. not sure why this is happening, probably something I missed in the code.

"<p>To gain some experience with Java's new streams, I've been developing a framework for handling playing cards. Here's the first version of my code for creating a <code>Map</code> containing the number of cards of each suit in a hand (<code>Suit</code> is an <code>enum</code>): </p>

<pre><code>Map&lt;Suit, Long&gt; countBySuit = contents.stream() // contents is ArrayList&lt;Card&gt;  
        .collect( Collectors.groupingBy( Card::getSuit, Collectors.counting() ));
</code></pre>

<p>This worked great and I was happy. Then I refactored, creating separate Card subclasses for ""Suit Cards"" and Jokers. So the <code>getSuit()</code> method was moved from the <code>Card</code> class to its subclass <code>SuitCard</code>, since Jokers don't have a suit. New code: </p>

<pre><code>Map&lt;Suit, Long&gt; countBySuit = contents.stream() // contents is ArrayList&lt;Card&gt;  
        .filter( card -&gt; card instanceof SuitCard ) // reject Jokers
        .collect( Collectors.groupingBy( SuitCard::getSuit, Collectors.counting() ) );
</code></pre>

<p>Notice the clever insertion of a filter to make sure that the card being considered is in fact a Suit Card and not a Joker. But it doesn't work! Apparently the <code>collect</code> line doesn't realize that the object it's being passed is GUARANTEED to be a <code>SuitCard</code>. </p>

<p>After puzzling over this for a good while, in desperation I tried inserting a <code>map</code> function call, and amazingly it worked! </p>

<pre><code>Map&lt;Suit, Long&gt; countBySuit = contents.stream() // contents is ArrayList&lt;Card&gt;  
        .filter( card -&gt; card instanceof SuitCard ) // reject Jokers
        .map( card -&gt; (SuitCard)card ) // worked to get rid of error message on next line
        .collect( Collectors.groupingBy( SuitCard::getSuit, Collectors.counting() ) );

<p>It doesn't seem like this is a destructive operation because it doesn't delete any local (non-remote) branches. It also seems like this is a great way to not build up remotes that aren't in use anymore without periodically specifying git fetch --prune or git remote prune. </p>

"<p>I tried to use enzyme to simulate <code>change</code> event on a checkbox, and use <code>chai-enzyme</code> to assert if it's been checked.</p>

<p>This is my <code>Hello</code> react component:</p>

<pre><code>import React from 'react';

class Hello extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      checked: false
    }
  }

  render() {
    const {checked} = this.state;
    return &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;input type=""checkbox"" defaultChecked={checked} onChange={this._toggle.bind(this)}/&gt;
      {
        checked ? ""checked"" : ""not checked""
      }
    &lt;/div&gt;
  }

  _toggle() {
    const {onToggle} = this.props;
    this.setState({checked: !this.state.checked});
    onToggle();
  }
}

export default Hello;
</code></pre>

<p>And my test:</p>

<pre><code>import React from ""react"";
import Hello from ""../src/hello.jsx"";
import chai from ""chai"";
import {mount} from ""enzyme"";
import chaiEnzyme from ""chai-enzyme"";
import jsdomGlobal from ""jsdom-global"";
import spies  from 'chai-spies';

function myAwesomeDebug(wrapper) {
  let html = wrapper.html();
  console.log(html);
  return html
}

jsdomGlobal();
chai.should();
chai.use(spies);
chai.use(chaiEnzyme(myAwesomeDebug));


describe('&lt;Hello /&gt;', () =&gt; {

  it('checks the checkbox', () =&gt; {
    const onToggle = chai.spy();
    const wrapper = mount(&lt;Hello onToggle={onToggle}/&gt;);

    var checkbox = wrapper.find('input');
    checkbox.should.not.be.checked();
    checkbox.simulate('change', {target: {checked: true}});
    onToggle.should.have.been.called.once();

    console.log(checkbox.get(0).checked);
    checkbox.should.be.checked();
  });

});
</code></pre>

<p>When I run this test, the <code>checkbox.get(0).checked</code> is <code>false</code>, and the assertion <code>checkbox.should.be.checked()</code> reports error:</p>

<pre><code>AssertionError: expected the node in &lt;Hello /&gt; to be checked &lt;input type=""checkbox"" checked=""checked""&gt;

"<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>In maven, an artifact can declare a dependency with</p>

<pre><code>&lt;optional&gt;true&lt;/optional&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>which means that the dependency is not required, but can be used if present.</p>

<p><a href=""http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw/spec/sotms/"">The State of the Module System</a> seems to specify that a module can only read modules it has required.</p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Does the Java 9 module system indeed not support optional dependencies?</li>
<li>Why not?</li>
<li>What alternatives to optional dependencies does the Java 9 module system provide? </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Use Case</strong></p>

<p>I have a framework that integrates various libraries that may or may not be used by an application. Currently, this framework is a single JAR that reflects upon the classpath to skip integration code for absent libraries. </p>

<p>I guess we could split this into a separate module for each configuration, but this would cause a combinatorial explosion in the number of JARs, because we'd not only need a separate JAR for each optional dependency, but also a separate JAR for most pairs of optional dependencies ...</p>

"**Problem 1.**

This problem provides practice using a while True loop.
Write a function named twoWords that gets and returns two words from a user. The first word is of a
specified length, and the second word begins with a specified letter.

The function twoWords takes two parameters:

i. an integer, length, that is the length of the first word and

ii. a character, firstLetter, that is the first letter of the second word. 

The second word may begin
with either an upper or lower case instance of firstLetter.
The function twoWords should return the two words in a list.
Use a while True loop and a break statement in the implementation of twoWords.
The following is an example of the execution of twoWords:
print(twoWords(4, 'B'))

A 4-letter word please two

A 4-letter word please one

A 4-letter word please four

"<p>Using the <a href=""https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/overview/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Pipeline plugin in Jenkins 2.x</a>, how can I access a Groovy variable that is defined somewhere at stage- or node-level from within a <code>sh</code> step?</p>

<p>Simple example:</p>

<pre><code>node {

        some_var = 'Hello World' // this is Groovy
        echo some_var // printing via Groovy works
        sh 'echo $some_var' // printing in shell does not work

<p>gives the following on the Jenkins output page:</p>

<pre><code>[Pipeline] {
[Pipeline] stage
[Pipeline] { (Test Stage)
[Pipeline] echo
Hello World
[Pipeline] sh
[test] Running shell script
+ echo

[Pipeline] }
[Pipeline] // stage
[Pipeline] }
[Pipeline] // node
[Pipeline] End of Pipeline
Finished: SUCCESS

<p>As one can see, <code>echo</code> in the <code>sh</code> step prints an empty string.</p>

<p>A work-around would be to define the variable in the environment scope via </p>

<p>I don't like that as it results in an unused variable <code>i</code>. The following approach avoids that and is what I am currently using:</p>

<pre><code>for i in pairs(armies) do
    doStuffWithArmyName(armies[i])
end

<p>However this is still not as readable and simple as I'd like, since this is iterating over the keys and then getting the value using the key (rather imperatively). Another boon I have with both approaches is that <code>pairs</code> is needed. The value being looped over here is one I have control over, and I'd prefer that it can be looped over as easily as possible.</p>

<p>Is there a better way to do such a loop if I only care about the values? Is there a way to address the concerns I listed?</p>

"<p>I wish to build my web application with the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Grail_(web_design)"" rel=""noreferrer"">Holy Grail layout</a>, with just one sidebar, and no footer.
The sidebar will be used as a navigation bar, as well as for holding interactive option for content that will be displayed in the center of the layout, depending on the currently chose link.
Meaning that, when choosing a link to navigate to in the navigation bar, it will affect the displayed content in the sidebar for custom interaction options, and the main content in the center.</p>

<p>For achieving this I have came up with couple of approaches:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Approach 1:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Have one Vue instance</li>
<li>Have a <code>Layout</code> component creating our layout, with <code>Header</code> and <code>Navbar</code> for sub-components.</li>
<li>Our Vue instance will use a router with a path for each link present in the navigation sidebar</li>
<li>Our Vue instance will render <strong>one</strong> <code>router-view</code> component to display the current path component</li>
<li>Each route will display a component that its template is using our previously created <code>Layout</code> component and inject the appropriate custom navigation options, and main content using slots.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p><code>Layout</code> component:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;template&gt;
&lt;div class=""app-layout""&gt;
    &lt;header-component&gt;&lt;/header-component&gt;
    &lt;div class=""main""&gt;
      &lt;navbar-component&gt;
        &lt;slot name=""navigation-menu""&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;
      &lt;/navbar-component&gt;
      &lt;main&gt;
        &lt;slot name=""main-content""&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;
      &lt;/main&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  import Header from './Header.vue';
  import Navbar from './Navbar.vue';
  export default {
    name: 'Layout',
    components: {
      'header-component': Header,
      'navbar-component': Navbar
    }
  };
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;style lang=""sass"" rel=""stylesheet/scss"" scoped&gt;
  some styling to achieve our layout for the present tags in the template
&lt;/style&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><code>Header</code> component:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;header v-once class=""header""&gt;
    &lt;router-link to=""/""&gt;
      Brand
    &lt;/router-link&gt;
  &lt;/header&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  export default {
    name: 'Header'
  };
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;style lang=""sass"" rel=""stylesheet/scss"" scoped&gt;
  some styling to achieve our layout for the present tags in the template
&lt;/style&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><code>Navbar</code> component:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;nav class=""navigation""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""links""&gt;
      // iterate on some property of this component, and create a list of links
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=""menu""&gt;
      &lt;slot name=""navigation-menu""&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/nav&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  export default {
    name: 'Navbar'
  };
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;style lang=""sass"" rel=""stylesheet/scss"" scoped&gt;
  some styling to achieve our layout for the present tags in the template
&lt;/style&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Vue instance with routing:</p>

<pre><code>import link1Component from './components/Link1ComponentUsingLayout.vue';
import link2Component from './components/Link2ComponentUsingLayout.vue';
import link3Component from './components/Link3ComponentUsingLayout.vue';

const router = new VueRouter({
  mode: 'history',
  routes: [
    {
      path: '/',
      redirect: '/link1'
    },
    {
      path: '/link1',
      name: 'link1',
      component: Link1ComponentUsingLayout
    },
    {
      path: '/link2',
      name: 'link2',
      component: Link2ComponentUsingLayout
    },
    {
      path: '/link3',
      name: 'link3',
      component: Link3ComponentUsingLayout
    }
  ]
});

export default new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  router,
  render: h =&gt; h('router-view')
});
</code></pre>

<ol start=""2"">
<li><strong>Approach 2:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Have two Vue instances</li>
<li>Have out layout as a static html inside index.html instead of a component</li>
<li>Each of the Vue instances will use a router (one for each), with a path for each link present in the navigation bar</li>
<li>One of the instances will be mounted on the html inside the navigation sidebar in our static html, and one inside the center content area</li>
<li>Each of the Vue instances will render <strong>one</strong> <code>router-view</code> component to display the current path component</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Approach 3:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Have one Vue instance</li>
<li>Our Vue instance will use a router with a path for each link present in the navigation sidebar</li>
<li>Or Vue instance will template will represent our layout and inside the navigation sidebar, and the center content area we'll have 2 <code>router-view</code> components</li>
<li>Our Vue instances will render both the navigation sidebar, and the center content are components for the current path</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Approach 4:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Same as Approach 3, except don't use router and use dynamic components to switch between the navigation sidebar, and the center content area components, whenever a link inside the navigation is clicked.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Now, I was wondering which approach would be the best and why?
Also I would like to hear new approaches if you have any, and explanation for why they're better.</p>

"I have a server application which has an ArrayList of connections. This program makes use of mutiple threads. The main thread runs a process at intervals to detect closed connections and then remove them from the array so they can be garbage collected.

This process is as follows:

    private void cullOtherProcessors() throws Exception {
    	//log.log(Level.FINE,""XMLMessageReciever:cullOtherProcessors"");
    	List<ConnectionAppInterface> toDel = new ArrayList<ConnectionAppInterface>();

    			if (cur.isClosed()) {

    				toDel.add(cur);

    		m_OtherProcessors.remove(toDel.get(c));
    	}

Basically something happened to the ArrayList while I was looping through it (possibly another connection being established) causing nextNode to throw the exception.

I am trying to work out the best method of getting around it. I am considering simply catching and ignoring the error. Any threads missed will simply be culled on the next loop. My proposed solution is:

    private void cullOtherProcessors() throws Exception {
		//log.log(Level.FINE,""XMLMessageReciever:cullOtherProcessors"");
    	//m_OtherProcessors
    	List<ConnectionAppInterface> toDel = new ArrayList<ConnectionAppInterface>();
    	try {
	    	for (ConnectionAppInterface cur : m_OtherProcessors.keySet()) {
	    		if (cur!=null) {
	    			if (cur.isClosed()) {
	    				//Connection is closed - we could never send a message over it
	    				toDel.add(cur);
	    			}
	    		}
	    	}
    	} catch (ConcurrentModificationException e) {
    		log.log(Level.FINE,""**XMLMessageReciever:cullOtherProcessors - ConcurrentModificationException being ignored"");
    	}
    	for (int c=0;c<toDel.size();c++) {
    		log.log(Level.FINE,""**XMLMessageReciever:cullOtherProcessors - removing closed connection"");
    		m_OtherProcessors.remove(toDel.get(c));
    	}
    }

I will now put this code back into the server and run it for more months.

I would like to know if this is a good solution to the problem. Since it took months for this to occur in the first place and the code loops connections every 5 minutes I think there is a low chance it would occur so often the connections will never be culled. (I will watch the logs and see)

It would be good to know what experts thinks.",LQ

"<p>I'm attempting to capture DynamoDB table changes using DynamoDB streams and the AWS provided Java DynamoDB streams Kinesis adapter. I'm working with the AWS Java SDKs in a Scala app.</p>

<p>I started by following the <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Streams.KCLAdapter.Walkthrough.html"">AWS guide</a> and by going through the AWS published <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Streams.KCLAdapter.Walkthrough.CompleteProgram.html"">code example</a>. However I'm having issues getting Amazon's own published code working in my environment. My issue lies with the <code>KinesisClientLibConfiguration</code> object.</p>

<p>In the example code, <code>KinesisClientLibConfiguration</code> is configured with the stream ARN provided by DynamoDB.</p>

<pre><code>new KinesisClientLibConfiguration(""streams-adapter-demo"",
    streamArn, 
    streamsCredentials, 
    ""streams-demo-worker"")
</code></pre>

<p>I followed a similar pattern in my Scala app by first locating the current ARN from my Dynamo table:</p>

<pre><code>lazy val streamArn = dynamoClient.describeTable(config.tableName)
.getTable.getLatestStreamArn
</code></pre>

<p>And then creating the <code>KinesisClientLibConfiguration</code> with the provided ARN:</p>

<pre><code>lazy val kinesisConfig :KinesisClientLibConfiguration =
new KinesisClientLibConfiguration(
  ""testProcess"",
  streamArn,
  defaultProviderChain,
  ""testWorker""
).withMaxRecords(1000)
   .withRegionName(""eu-west-1"")
   .withMetricsLevel(MetricsLevel.NONE)
  .withIdleTimeBetweenReadsInMillis(500)
  .withInitialPositionInStream(InitialPositionInStream.TRIM_HORIZON)
</code></pre>

<p>I've verified the provided stream ARN and everything matches what I see in the AWS console.</p>

<p>At runtime I end up getting an exception stating that the provided ARN is not a valid stream name:</p>

<pre><code>com.amazonaws.services.kinesis.clientlibrary.lib.worker.ShardSyncTask call
SEVERE: Caught exception while sync'ing Kinesis shards and leases
com.amazonaws.services.kinesis.model.AmazonKinesisException: 1 validation     
error detected: Value 'arn:aws:dynamodb:eu-west-1:STREAM ARN' at 
'streamName'    failed to satisfy constraint: Member must satisfy regular 
expression pattern: [a-zA-Z0-9_.-]+ (Service: AmazonKinesis; Status Code: 
400; Error Code: ValidationException; Request ID: )
</code></pre>

<p>Looking at the documentation provided on <code>KinesisClientLibConfiguration</code> this does make sense as the second parameter is listed as the <em>streamName</em> without any mention of an ARN.</p>

<p>I can't seem to find anything on <code>KinesisClientLibConfiguration</code> that is related to an ARN. Since I'm working with a DynamoDB stream and not a Kinesis stream I'm also unsure how to find my stream name.</p>

<p>At this point I'm unsure what I'm missing from the published AWS example, it seems like they may be using a much older version of the KCL. I'm using version 1.7.0 of amazon-kinesis-client.</p>

"<p>I know this question has been asked many times, but I tried pretty much everything I could find on the net and still can't get the text to render properly in canvas no matter what (and with whatever combinations) I tried.</p>

<p>For the blurry lines and shapes problem, simply adding +0.5px to the coordinates solved the problem : however, this solution doesn't seem to work for text rendering.</p>

<p>Note : I never use CSS to set canvas width and height (just tried it once to check if setting size properties in both HTML and CSS would change anything). Also problem doesn't seem to be browser-related.</p>

<p>I tried : </p>

<ul>
<li>creating canvas with HTML, then with javascript instead of html</li>
<li>setting width and height in HTML element, then with JS, then with both HTML and JS</li>
<li>add 0.5px to text coordinates with every possible combination</li>
<li>changing font-family and font-size</li>
<li>changing font-size unit (px, pt, em)</li>
<li>opening file with different browsers to check if anything changes</li>
<li>disabling alpha channel using <code>canvas.getContext('2d', {alpha:false})</code> which just made most of my layers disapear without solving the problem</li>

"<p>I am learning Angular2, after working with Angular1 for a couple of years. I'm creating a credit card form component, with the main goal to learn a couple of key concepts in Angular2. The component should handle all formatting, and return a Stripe token through a callback. I realised that I can handle callbacks in two ways.</p>

<p><strong>Using an @Output parameter</strong></p>

<p>In my component I define a output variable and use it like in this example:</p>

<pre><code>export class CreditCardForm{
    ....
    @Output () callback = new EventEmitter();
    ....

    doCallback(){
        this.callback.emit({data: 123});
    }
}

// Parent view
&lt;credit-card-form (callback)=""creditCardCallback($event)""&gt;&lt;/credit-card-form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Using an @Input variable</strong></p>

<p>However, I could just pass the callback method (<code>creditCardCallback</code>, used in the parent template) to an input variable, like this:</p>

<pre><code>export class CreditCardForm{
    ....
    @Input () callback;
    ....

    doCallback(){
        this.callback({data: 123});
    }
}

// Parent view
&lt;credit-card-form [callback]=""creditCardCallback""&gt;&lt;/credit-card-form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>The question</strong></p>

<p>Why would I want to use <code>@Output</code> over <code>@Input</code>? What do I achieve by using <code>@Output</code> variables instead? As far as I can see, this just adds an overhead by having to utilise the <code>EventEmitter</code> class.</p>

"<p>I'm using the Ionic v2 beta with Typescript, and would love to use <code>--strictNullChecks</code>.  However, dependencies of my project, such as @angular/core, cause compilation errors when I put <code>strictNullChecks: true</code> in my <code>tsconfig.json</code>.</p>

<p>Is there a way to declare a directory / file / module / class as abiding by strictNullChecks, even when the overall project cannot be compiled with the flag?</p>

<p>It seems that, since <code>--strictNullChecks</code> is not the default, it will have extremely limited use (despite being an extremely useful feature) as a result of dependencies that were written without the flag.</p>

"<h2>Scenario</h2>

<p>From a Windows 10 Anniversary Update client ...</p>

<ul>
<li>Open a web browser, copy / paste some text from a website (eg. GitHub)</li>
<li>Use PuTTY 0.67 to SSH to a Linux VM (eg. Ubuntu 16 Xenial Xerus)</li>
<li>Open a file in Vim</li>
<li>Hit <code>i</code> to change into Insert mode</li>
<li>Right-click to paste the clipboard contents</li>

<h2>Issue</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, when I right-click in the PuTTY session, rather than pasting clipboard contents, what's actually happening is that Vim is going from <code>INSERT</code> mode to <code>(insert) VISUAL</code> mode. I don't think I've ever seen anything like this before.</p>

"<p>I've picked realm to store data in my React Native app. I don't understand, how to organize files in my project. Documentation provides only simple code for one component. But I need for different components different parts of database.</p>

"Good afternoon lads,

yesterday morning i was thinking: ""is there a way to group words with a given lenght of letters in python?""

so i started working on this function:

    lenght_words(a,b,text):
    returnlist = []

in the returnlist i want the words which have lenght:

 a <= lenght <= b

so i was thinking:

1. split the lines of the text in order to have the function operating on differents lines of the text
2. remove the punctuation from the lines
3. if in a line there are words which have the right lenght, the function must put them in the returnlist with a space between each word (e.g. 'cat dog'), otherwise the function put ''

i know there is the splitlines() method, but i don't know how to use it (even after readng about it)

i want to give an example of how the function has to work:

    function(6,7,'All in the golden afternoon\nFull leisurely we glide;\nFor  both our oars, with little skill,\nBy little arms are plied.')

this function should separate the lines:

All in the golden afternoon

Full leisurely we glide;

For  both our oars,

with little skill,

By little arms are plied.

 --> delete the punctuation and return:
   
    ['golden','','little','little']

i know i have to append the words to the return list, but i don't know how to proceed

"<p>Is there a way to insert or update/replace multiple documents in MongoDB with a single query?</p>

<p>Assume the following collection:</p>

<pre><code>[
    {_id: 1, text: ""something""},
    {_id: 4, text: ""baz""}
]
</code></pre>

<p>Now I would like to add multiple documents of which some might already be in the collection. If the documents are already in the collection, I would like to update/replace them. For example, I would like to insert the following documents:</p>

<pre><code>[
    {_id:1, text: ""something else""},
    {_id:2, text: ""foo""},
    {_id:3, text: ""bar""}
]
</code></pre>

<p>The query should insert the documents with <code>_id</code> 2 and 3. It should also update/replace the document with <code>_id</code> 1. After the process, the collection should look as follows:</p>

<pre><code>[
    {_id:1, text: ""something else""},
    {_id:2, text: ""foo""},
    {_id:3, text: ""bar""},
    {_id:4, text: ""baz""}

<p>One approach might be to use <a href=""https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.insertMany/"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>insertMany</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>db.collection.insertMany(
   [ {...}, {...}, {...} ],
   {
      ordered: false,
   }
)
</code></pre>

<p>If duplicates occur, that query will emit a <code>writeErrors</code> containing an array of objects containing the indexes of the documents that failed to insert. I could go through them and update them instead.</p>

    input('Press enter to exit')

Is there a way to handle errors in my shortened version? Any help would be appreciated. I'm very new to this. Thanks!",LQ

<p>And app component with template:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;app-middle (submit)=""submitListener($event)""&gt;&lt;/app-middle&gt;

<p>Now, submitListener will be called</p>

<ul>
<li>when submit on app-middle is called (wanted behavior)</li>
<li>when form is submitted, because native event bubble to the top (""parasitic"" behavior)</li>
</ul>

<p>I suppose, ""parasitic"" behavior is based on DOM event bubbling. 
I can stop it by event.stopPropagation() in submitButtonClicked handler, but if I forgot stop it, I get pretty ugly errors.</p>

<p>Generally, I consider this behavior quite dangerous. If I am not wrong, every event binding expression handler can be potentially called ""parasitically"" by native event from inner components.

"<p>I'm trying to write a <code>DataResolver</code> service that will allow the Angular 2 router to preload data before initializing my component.</p>

<p>The resolver needs to call different API endpoints to fetch data appropriate to the route being loaded.  Rather than having a resolver for each of my many components, I'm building one generic resolver. Thus, I'd like to pass custom input in the route definition that points to the correct endpoint. For instance, consider these routes:</p>

<p><strong>app.routes.ts</strong></p>

<pre><code>appRoutes = [
  {
     path: 'project/:id',
     component: ProjectComponent,
     resolve: { data: DataResolver }
  },
  {
     path: 'store/:id',
     component: StoreComponent,
     resolve: { data: DataResolver }
  }
]
</code></pre>

<p>In the first instance, the resolver will need to call <code>/path/to/resource1/id</code>. In the second case, <code>/path/to/resource2/id</code>. Ideally, I would pass the endpoint as an argument in the route definition that would then be available in the <code>DataResolver</code> constructor.</p>

A store announces a sale campaign whereby any customer who buys two items gets

1. Suppose you want to buy n items in total. Write a method that will give you

2. If you leave it up to the store owner, he/she will try to pair the items in order
to obtain the maximum price. Write a method that will help the store owner
achieve this. The method's signature is:
public static LinkedList<ItemPair> maxPairing(LinkedList<Item> items).
3. How much will you gain if you use your method (instead of the shop owner's

"<p>I'm transfering my .NET Framework (EF6) code to ASP.NET Core (EF Core), and I stumbled upon this issue. Here is some example code:</p>

<p>In EF6 I use Include() and Select() for eager-loading:</p>

<pre><code>return _context.Post
.Include(p =&gt; p.PostAuthor.Select(pa =&gt; pa.Author).Select(a =&gt; a.Interests))
</code></pre>

<p>PostAuthor is a junction table and there is also a Junction table ""AuthorInterest"" which I didn't need to involve in EF6 (Select goes straight to a.Interests).</p>

<p>Anyway, I can see that in EF7 this is reworked, meaning that I should use ThenInclude() for nested queries now. However...</p>

<pre><code>return _context.Post
  .Include(p =&gt; p.PostAuthor)
    .ThenInclude(pa =&gt; pa.Select(pa2 =&gt; pa2.Author))
...etc
</code></pre>

<p>The above code fails because of the Select() statement. The documentation on <a href=""https://docs.efproject.net/en/latest/querying/related-data.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://docs.efproject.net/en/latest/querying/related-data.html</a> seems to suggest that I don't need it and I can access Author immediately, but I get an ICollection in the last lambda displayed, so I obviously need the Select(). I go through multiple junction tables further on in the query, but for simplicity's sake, let's just focus on the first one.</p>

<p>How do I make this work?</p>

So for the line:

struct entry *findEntry (struct entry *listPtr, int match) 

why is there a * in front of find entry? Because it is supposed to be a function declaration but *findEntry is a pointer? I do not understand what the statement at all.... 

On the book the explanation is: specifies that the function findEntry () returns a pointer to an entry structure and that it takes such a pointer as its first argument and an integer as its second

In that case is the * sign needed?

"<p>I'm making an Angular 2 web app. I have a model that is comprised of a few key properties, and then several other properties that are computed based off those key values.</p>

<p>All of my properties have getter methods. To keep my computed properties in sync with my key properties, the key properties are changed via setter methods which re-evaluate all of the computed properties. Here's a simplified example:</p>

<pre><code>export class Model{
    private _keyValue: number;
    private _computedValue: number;

    getKeyValue(): number{
        return this._keyValue;
    }

    setKeyValue(value: number){
        this._keyValue = value;
        this.evaluateComputedValues(); // This might be time-consuming
    }

    getComputedValue(): number{
        return this._computedValue;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This keeps my model consistent: every time one of the key properties is changed, all of the computed properties are re-computed.</p>

<p>Now I need to figure out how to bind my properties to my component views. It seems like I can present the computed property getters using interpolation:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;{{model.getComputedValue()}}&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However, I'm not sure what the best way to bind my key properties to input fields would be. All of the examples of using two-way binding seem to use ngModel like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input [(ngModel)]='model.property'&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However, that seems geared towards binding to simple properties. I ideally need two-way binding using my separate getter and setter methods (getKeyValue and setKeyValue).</p>

"<p>Before asking my question I'd like to tell you that I am very new to react and till now I have learned very basic concepts of <strong>react</strong> like component, state, prop, router etc. and may be this question is very funny but I need the solution for that. Please correct me if I am wrong somewhere.</p>

<p>So my question is, can we run react based application without running application on server ?. Basically, I want that, I can directly use index.html file path on web browser and my app starts working.</p>

<p>My understanding is that React js is a javascript library and all the code eventually converted into plain javascript files using babel loader(if we are using ES6). So I think it should be possible to do this.</p>

<p>I have discovered that I can use <strong>webpack</strong> which internally first convert my React based or other js files into normal javascript and make one single bundle file that can be used in Index.html file for further use. I've tried this but only some features are working fine like state, prop but many other features are not working like react-router but when I used npm server all the features start working fine.</p>

<p>Now why I want to do this is because I want to use react js to create <strong>Samsung Tizen TV web application</strong> where I don't think that I can use npm server and all.</p>

<p>If anybody has any solution on that it would be very helpful.

"<p>I'm working on an app with controller that have lots of before_actions. Most of them are connected with each other by instance variables that they set. For example:</p>

    @second_variable = Other.new

    second_action

"<p>My app is using a <code>NotificationListener</code> to read out messages from various 3rd party apps, for example WhatsApp.</p>

<p>So far I was able to send a reply if only one chat is unread, the code is below.</p>

<p>However, in the case with WhatsApp, <code>getNotification().actions</code> returns a null object when more than two chats are unread, as the messages are bundled together. As you can see in the pictures below, if the notifications are extended there is an option to send a direct reply as well, therefore I am certain that it is possible to utilize this, also I think apps like PushBullet are using this method.</p>

<p>How could I access the RemoteInput of that notification?</p>

<pre><code>public static ReplyIntentSender sendReply(StatusBarNotification statusBarNotification, String name) {

            Notification.Action actions[] = statusBarNotification.getNotification().actions;

            for (Notification.Action act : actions) {

                    if (act.title.toString().contains(name)) {
                        if (act.getRemoteInputs() != null)
                            return new ReplyIntentSender(act);

                }
            }
            return null;
        }



public static class ReplyIntentSender {
      [...]

    public final Notification.Action action;

    public ReplyIntentSender(Notification.Action extractedAction) {
            action = extractedAction;
     [...]
    }

private boolean sendNativeIntent(Context context, String message) {
            for (android.app.RemoteInput rem : action.getRemoteInputs()) {
                Intent intent = new Intent();
                Bundle bundle = new Bundle();
                bundle.putCharSequence(rem.getResultKey(), message);
                android.app.RemoteInput.addResultsToIntent(action.getRemoteInputs(), intent, bundle);
                try {
                    action.actionIntent.send(context, 0, intent);
                } catch (Exception e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                    return false;
                }

            }
            return false;
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Some explanation how the above code works: Once a notification is received  the app tries to get the actions and checks if the name is in the title of a remoteInput (normally it is in the format of ""Reply to $NAME""), if that is found the Action is saved into a ReplyIntentSender class, which, when triggered by <code>sendNativeIntent</code>, cycles through all RemoteInputs of that Action and adds the message to the intent. If more than one chat is unread, <code>getNotification().actions</code> returns null.</p>

"<p>How can I make Spring log properly via <code>log4j2</code> along with the other dependencies I have (Hibernate, Netty, Mina, etc.)?</p>

"Suggestions for improving this question are encouraged. I'll update this question to more precisely explain what caused the problem once we figure out what was causing it to help those with a similar DOM structure.

Unfortunately, I cannot post my code for this since it's closed source.

I see a few examples of how to set width this way, but few explanations of what can prevent it from working.

I have some elements in my HTML that are responding properly to css that is setting the width by using `position: absolute; left: 0; right: 200;` however, I have one div which simply won't respond to both left AND right. I seem to be able to set it's left OR right, but if both are set, it only seems to calculate it's position based off of the left value.

* I am not setting the width of the div anywhere.<br>
    -I've tried setting `width: auto;`<br>
    -I've tried setting `position: relative;`<br>
    -I've tried various values for `left` and `right` I'm not using variables
* The div contains an element whose width is 100%<br>
* I'm not trying to center the div, I want to set it's width this way (specifically so that I can define it's width so that it will take up it's entire parent minus some other divs that may or may not be present who have fixed widths, the parent's width is variable)
* The div is nested deep inside of several other layers, is there a setting in a parent container that might be causing this behavior? If so, what might prevent it?
* I am setting the css in Javascript after the element has been created but before it's being added to its container, I don't think this is a timing problem, but it might be relevant.
* Are there specific parent elements that might interfere?
* Are there styles that might be inherited that might interfere?


What are some possible situations that can cause this css to fail to set the width of an element?

"Is Sign Extension an option to be enabled or disabled by the compiler or it is compiler dependent or Target dependent?

The following code has been compiled on 3 different compilers and 3 different processors and gave 2 different results

    typedef signed long long s64;
    int main ()

I do understand that the operation of `(Operand1-Operand2)` is done in as 32bit unsigned calculation then when casted to ""s64"" sign extension was done correctly in the firs case but not done correctly for the 2nd case.

My question is whether the sign extension is possible to be controlled via compiler options, or it is compiler dependent or maybe it is target dependent.

<p>It's like 70K lines of scala code. We are on scala 2.11.7</p>

<p>Development is getting difficult because compilation - the edit-compile-test-debug cycle is too long for small changes.</p>

<p>Incremental recompile times can be a minute, and this is without optimization turned on. Sometimes longer. And that's with not having edited very many changes into files. Sometimes a very small change causes a huge recompilation.</p>

<p>So my question: What can I do by way of organizing the code, that will improve compilation time?</p>

<p>E.g., decomposing code into smaller files? Will this help?</p>

<p>E.g., more smaller libraries?</p>

<p>E.g., avoiding use of implicits? (we have very few)</p>

<p>E.g., avoiding use of traits? (we have tons)</p>

<p>E.g., avoiding lots of imports? (we have tons - package boundaries are pretty chaotic at this point)</p>

<p>Or is there really nothing much I can do about this?</p>

<p>I feel like this very long compilation is somehow due to some immense amount of recompiling due to dependencies, and I am thinking of how to reduce <em>false</em> dependencies....but that's just a theory</p>

<p>I'm hoping someone else can shed some light on <em>something</em> we might do which would improve compilation speed for incremental changes.</p>

"<p>According to <a href=""http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string_view/operator_cmp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cppreference</a>, <code>std::string_view::operator==</code> is constexpr. I have trouble finding a situation for this to be true with current library implementations.</p>

<p>Here's what I tried:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;string_view&gt;

constexpr char x0[] = ""alpha"";
constexpr char y0[] = ""alpha"";
constexpr auto x = std::string_view(x0, 5);
constexpr auto y = std::string_view(y0, 5);

constexpr auto a = std::string_view(""alpha"", 5);
constexpr auto b = std::string_view(""alpha"", 5);

int main()

  // a, b, x, y are all constexpr, operator== is constexpr
  // therefore I expected this to compile:
  static_assert(x == y);
  static_assert(a == b);
}

<p>With gcc-trunk, this does not compile because in libstdc++ the operator== is not constexpr at all.</p>

<p>With clang-trunk this also fails because operator==() is declared constexpr, but uses char_traits::compare() which is not constexpr.</p>

"<p>I'm building an app that can load various modules (other bundles generated by different webpack configs) on demand.

"<p>I have some old-school plain old ES5 JavaScript that I need to pull into my application that is using webpack as a bundler.

"OK so I'm having trouble with this question in my Database homework.

I need to answer this question:

> Select the name of the Employee and the email address for the employee
> that has the highest individual sale for the current month.

So I basically need to select the employee with the most sales for the current month.

And here's what I have:

    SELECT FirstName + ' ' + LastName as 'Employee Name', Email FROM Employee 
    INNER JOIN Sale
    ON Employee.EmployeeNumber = Sale.EmployeeNumber
    GROUP BY Sale.SaleDate, Sale.SaleNumber, Employee.FirstName, Employee.LastName, Employee.Email
    HAVING DatePart(Month, SaleDate) = DatePart(Month, GetDate()) AND ...

The only thing I'm missing is the second part of my HAVING statement.

The query I currently have returns these [Current Query Results][1]

I originally thought of using Max(Count(SaleNumber)) however I get an error saying I can't use aggregate functions within each other. So I have no clue how to get the result I want.

If you worry about this affecting my learning experience, it won't. You'll probably just be teaching me a whole new way to look at this problem :)

"Hi Can any one please help me on the below query.
I am working on a scala code where I have a Scala collections list 'students' as shown below.

**List(students(Rajesh,21,branch1,sem1), 
students(Kamal,25,branch2,sem2)
students(Kavitha,23,branch3,sem3))**

Here students is the case class like 
case class students(name:String,age:Int,branchname:String,semname: String)

Now my requirement is to get the name for a particular branch. How can i get that. Can any one please help on the same. 

I can convert the Scala list students into dataframe using .toDF() and write the where conditions to read the appropriate row and get the value.

But since the data is very small for me in this case so I want to use purely scala collections List.

Can any one please help on the same. ",LQ

"<p>I'd like to put a colour picker as a column type inside a <code>rhandsontable</code> in a <code>shiny</code> app. Using <code>colourInput()</code> from the <code>colourpicker</code> package, I can add colour pickers as stand-alone inputs, create them from HTML tags, or put them in HTML tables (see example code below). Is it possible to add colour picker input controls to <code>rhandsontable</code> columns? </p>

<p>The end goal is an application that allows users to copy data from a spreadsheet like MS Excel and paste into the <code>rhandsontable</code> object, including text specifying the color name or Hex code. Users can edit colours by overwriting text or selecting a color from the picker via cursor action. The app would later take those inputs, perform calculations, and graph results in the specified colors.</p>

<p>Below is some sample code showing two failed attempts. Any advice would be appreciated. Also, I know nothing about JavaScript.

"First, sorry for my english. I faced a very weird Java syntax from the solution of one gate from CodeFights. 

- Here is the description:

""In order to stop the Mad Coder evil genius you need to decipher the encrypted message he sent to his minions. The message contains several numbers that, when typed into a supercomputer, will launch a missile into the sky blocking out the sun, and making all the people on Earth grumpy and sad.

You figured out that some numbers have a modified single digit in their binary representation. More specifically, in the given number n the kth bit from the right was initially set to 0, but its current value might be different. It's now up to you to write a function that will change the kth bit of n back to 0.

Example

For n = 37 and k = 3, the output should be
killKthBit(n, k) = 33.

3710 = 1001012 ~> 1000012 = 3310.

For n = 37 and k = 4, the output should be

killKthBit(n, k) = 37.

The 4th bit is 0 already (looks like the Mad Coder forgot to encrypt this number), so the answer is still 37.""

- Here is a solution I found and I cannot understand it:

    int killKthBit(int n, int k)
    {
      return n & ~(1 << (k - 1)) ;
    }

Can someone explain what the solution does and its syntax?

"<p>I have a S3 bucket on top of which there is CloudFront CDN.</p>

<p>This S3 bucket is ""immutable"", which means that once I upload a file there, I never delete it or update it. It is then safe that all clients cache the files coming from S3/CloudFront very aggressively.</p>

<p>Currently, Etags are working great, and clients hit 304 responses most of the time. But getting a 304 response still involve a roundtrip that could be avoided by more aggressive caching.</p>

<p>So I'd like this behavior:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>CloudFront CDN cache should never get invalidated, because S3 cache never changes. CloudFront does not need to ask again S3 for a file more than once. I think I've successfully configured that using CloudFront distribution settings.</p></li>
<li><p>CloudFront should serve all files with header <code>Cache-Control: max-age=365000000, immutable</code> (<a href=""http://bitsup.blogspot.fr/2016/05/cache-control-immutable.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">immutable</a> is a new, partially supported value as of 2016)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I don't understand how can I achieve the desired result. Should I handle that at CloudFront or S3 level? I've read some stuff about configuring appropriate header for each S3 file. Isn't there a global setting to serve all files with a custom http header that I could use?</p>

<p>I tried giving styles using the cell object but it is not reflecting in the downloaded .xlsx file.

Still I don't want to force all users of the module to handle the rejection explicitly. By design in some cases it makes sense to just ignore the returned promise. Also I don't want to take the ability to handle the promise rejection away from module users.</p>

<p>What is the way to properly do so?</p>

<p>After upgrading to Node.js 7.1.0 all my unit tests which ignore rejection handling show the following warning:</p>

<pre><code>(node:12732) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Unhandled promise rejection (rejection id: 1): Error: try to throw an error from unit test
(node:12732) DeprecationWarning: Unhandled promise rejections are deprecated. In the future, promise rejections that are not handled will terminate the Node.js process with a non-zero exit code.
</code></pre>

<p>What is the proper way to prevent termination of Node.js process in the future mentioned in <code>DeprecationWarning</code> description?</p>

"<p>I have been caught in a pickle. And am unable to find my answers from other SO questions or from reading the git documentation. I would really appreciate your help here.</p>

<p>After merging my branch on Github, I delete my branch from the UI (remote).
Periodically I prune my local branches:    </p>

<pre><code>git checkout master
git pull origin master
git fetch -p
git branch -d X
Error: error: The branch X is not fully merged. If you are sure you want to delete it, run 'git branch -D X'
</code></pre>

<p>The branch X has been merged. And I can see the commits from X when I do <code>git log</code> on <code>master</code>. Why does this happen? I want to use <code>-d</code> and not <code>-D</code> since this could lead to disastrously deletion of branches that were genuinely not merged. </p>

<ul>

<li>Company has 2 different domains like <strong>abc.com</strong> as <strong>abc</strong> and <strong>xyz.com</strong> as <strong>xyz</strong>. </li>
<li>Also there is a <strong>masterdomain</strong> that manages clients authentication. </li>
<li>User <strong>X</strong> wants to log in <strong>abc</strong> at first. </li>
<li><strong>abc</strong> sends credentials to <strong>masterdomain</strong> and <strong>masterdomain</strong> authenticates user then create a signed jwt in order to send back to <strong>abc</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>abc</strong> keeps this jwt in a cookie. </li>
<li>After a while if a login to <strong>abc</strong> is attempted at the same computer, system does not ask for credentials and automatically login the user.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>

<p>If user tries to open a page in <strong>xyz</strong> domain, how does the system understand that the user loggedin before? I mean <strong>xyz</strong> domain cannot reach the cookie of <strong>abc</strong> which has the jwt. What information should be sent to <strong>xyz</strong> that indicates the user <strong>X</strong> is trying to login? </p>

"<p>I have a situation in my Redux application where I currently have 3 separate reducers that handle the fetching of data from an api. An example of one of my reducers would be:</p>

<pre><code>const INITIAL_STATE = {
  data: [],
  loading: false,
  error: ''
};

export default (state = INITIAL_STATE, action) =&gt; {
  switch (action.type) {

        loading: false,
        error: action.payload
      };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
</code></pre>

<p>Note the loading and error states, these are identical in each current reducer and will be for any subsequent reducers I write that involve fetching data from the api.</p>

<p>I would like to add a further reducer that is used only for the loading and error pieces of state. The other 3 would store the data.</p>

<p>This would give me:</p>

<p>Data reducers x 3</p>

<pre><code>const INITIAL_STATE = {
  data: []
  // any other state in the future
};

export default (state = INITIAL_STATE, action) =&gt; {
  switch (action.type) {
    case GET_ALL_ORDERS_SUCCESS:
      return {
        ...state,
        allOrders: action.payload
      };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
</code></pre>

<p>Loading / Error reducer (handles loading / error for entire app)</p>

<pre><code>const INITIAL_STATE = {
  loading: false,
  error: ''
};

export default (state = INITIAL_STATE, action) =&gt; {
  switch (action.type) {
    case GET_ALL_ORDERS_START:
      return {
        ...state,
        loading: true
      };
    case GET_ALL_ORDERS_SUCCESS:
      return {
        ...state,

        loading: false,
        error: action.payload
      };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

"<p>In our application we need an indeterminate progress bar, like so:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iolAB.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iolAB.png"" alt=""progress bar how it should be""></a></p>

<p>We can achieve this by setting a negative margin on the ProgressBar, like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ProgressBar
    android:id=""@+id/progressbar""
    style=""?android:attr/progressBarStyleHorizontal""
    android:layout_width=""match_parent""
    android:layout_height=""wrap_content""
    android:indeterminate=""true""
    android:marginTop=""-7dp""
    android:visibility=""@{loading ? View.VISIBLE : View.GONE}"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>BUT</strong> because ConstraintLayout does not support negative margins, it will look like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/giPuj.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/giPuj.png"" alt=""progress bar with padding""></a></p>

<p>OK, the negative margin was a hack. Let's replace it with a different hack, shall we? Let's introduce our custom view <code>CustomProgressBar</code>, which extends <code>ProgressBar</code> and overrides its <code>onDraw</code> method, like this:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
protected void onDraw(Canvas canvas) {
    int marginTop = dpToPx(7);
    canvas.translate(0, -marginTop);
    super.onDraw(canvas);
}
</code></pre>

<p>But all of this smells like bad code. There has to be a better solution!
What would you recommend?</p>

<p>Some posts say that it doesn't support it yet or partially supports it, some tell you to add all your redis connection addresses to the connection string and some tell you that they provided a custom implementation by subscribing to events.</p>

"<p>I have this code:</p>

df = sqlContext.createDataFrame(l, ['name', 'age'])
df.withColumn('age2', df.age + 2).toPandas()

<p>Works fine, does what it needs to. Suppose though I only want to display the first n rows, and then call <code>toPandas()</code> to return a pandas dataframe. How do I do it? I can't call <code>take(n)</code> because that doesn't return a dataframe and thus I can't pass it to <code>toPandas()</code>.</p>

<p>So to put it another way, how can I take the top n rows from a dataframe and call <code>toPandas()</code> on the resulting dataframe? Can't think this is difficult but I can't figure it out.</p>

"I am starting to learn about HTML. I am really new to this so I hope this question is ok.

I have made my first html document with the basic structure of html.
I'm using notepad++ to create the page.

I am attempting to learn how to use relative pathways when inserting an image into the html document.

I have saved this document as filename.html 
I have saved this page in a folder called web_pages.
The image is in a folder called new_images.
The images folder and pages folder are inside a folder called project.

The picture is saved as a gif file with the name first_image.

when I run the page, the content is successfully showing. However the only thing that is showing for the image is the alternative text.

So I am assuming the pathway i'm using is incorrect?

I have the tag as <img scr=""../new_images/first_image.gif"" alt=""alternative text!"" style =""width 200px; height 300px;""> 
I have attempt some alternative pathways with use of ../../ 

I have tried moving both the first html file and the image to the same folder to see if that would work. and changing the img tag to match the new location, but nothing?

I have put them in their own folders and attempt the above link

I have looked at each title numerous times to make sure the names in the link are identical to what my image and file are called

is it because there needs to be a starting point that I am missing? 
Is it because I haven't created an index page ( which i'm not entirely sure about)?

May I ask if when it comes to the ""root directory"" does that have to be created at a certain location where all projects should be started at on my computer?

i'm trying to avoid using c:// which I believe is an absolute pathway?

or do I need the index page? 
If so is the index page the first page that will be viewed that a user will go to when they enter the web address?

    for (var i = 0; i < this.array.length; i++) {

The array here is a collection of HTML elements created by using query selector.

This code is held within a prototype method that is passed the parameter 'func'. The value passed for 'func' is an anonymous function.

With the code above I can successfully pass the counter 'i' back to the anonymous function.

One of the other methods, will use Javascript's parentNode function over the array of elements. Here is the problem, with the code above an error is caused saying the array element is not an object.

However when this code is used that error doesn't occur.

    for (var i = 0; i < this.array.length; i++) {
    
    var object = this;
    
    (function (object,i) {
    
    object.array.[i].addEventListener(event, func, false)
    
    }(object,i));

"Hello I'm newbie to ARDUINO. My project is about traffic light in this project our objective is to..

Create a sensor that will benefit travelers at an intersection that are likely to be realized by our sensor only when the signal is truly needed. Our sensors will help lessen road traffic. We target mostly the lanes/intersection that gets congested the most. The sensor will signal the increments of one lane (ex. The lane that gets congested the most, will increase the time the vehicles can pass, while the other lane will increase the time that they are stopped.) The sensors also make sure that the flow of traffic will be coordinated and organized. It will also enhance intersection safety measures.

"So, I am just getting started on programming. Got my second asignment but there is something really bothering me.

If you see the ""min"" value is sometimes single and sometimes repeating.
Hence I want to remove this repetition of ""min"" value. It has to be a single value.

So i want to parse the full string(very long string), and find if ""min"" has multiple values. If it has multiple value, then replace it with single value.

Example if 
""min"":[""BKK213AB1CD23456"",""BKK213AB1CD23456""] 
replace with 
""min"":""BKK213AB1CD23456""

    }

    // Structure B
    struct B : A
    {
      double X absolute A;
      double Y absolute B;
      double Z absolute C;
    }

Ok, I can use ""double & X = A"" in structure B but this will generate an additional pointer and change the size of the structure. Union is - I think - also not a solution, because structure B inherits structure A.

What I really want ist to have access to the same memory by accessing for example X or A (like Delphi allows that by using ""absolute"").

Thanks in advanced for your (hopefully positive) answers :-)

"I am a beginner at java and just need to find out how to send multiple parameters to one method (being 'game()'). The program is not complete I just need to get that bit working before I continue. The program is a 'safe-cracker' which takes user input and tells them if there guess is correct or not (I haven't done that part of the code yet).

-----------------

Wrt,

 `lptr->array = memcpy(lptr->array, list->array, list->size*sizeof(void*));`

`memcpy` is passing double pointers. A double pointer is a single pointer to single pointer, so it can be passed to a function that expects a void pointer, But, the actual copy of array of `void*` should not work

I actually need to copy the array. if `memcpy` is called, like,

 `lptr->array = memcpy(*(lptr->array), *(list->array), list->size*sizeof(void*));`


then,

Does `memcpy` perform copy operation, successfully?",LQ

"I'm having some trouble iterating through a list comprised of tuples, I have run this program several times in different ways, and it seems that the problem is with the indice in the for loop, I've tried changing it, but it always gives me the same problem.
Whenever I run the program the only outcome is:

    ('joao', 300, 20)

Can anyone please explain to me with this is happening?

Here is the code:

    tuplo = [('joao',300,20),('ana',80,15),('patricia',17,90)]
    def coordenadas(tuplo,nome):
        for indice in range(len(tuplo)):        
            if tuplo[indice][0] == nome:
                print(tuplo[indice][o:])

    coordenadas(tuplo,'joao')

"I'm currently working on a project in which 2 random integers between 0 and 20 are generated. A random operator (+, -, or *) is also selected. 

The user must enter the correct answer in 3 attempts. If they get it on the first attempt, they are awarded 5 points, second attempt, 3 points, and third attempt, 1 point. If after 3 attempts they still don't get the correct answer, they receive 0 points and a new set of numbers and an operator are generated.

My problem is that they need to update certain columns of the table. Is there a way to provide a method where they could choose which column they want to update?  
The alternative I know is to create a different method for each column, having for example

    Update.updateAge(int age);

"**I AM FULLY AWARE OF THIS QUESTION AND ANSWER: 
http://stackoverflow.com/a/4796911/2307520
BUT THIS IS A BIT DIFFERENT PROBLEM!**

Yes, I understand how they simulated simple OUTER JOIN in MySQL using union and two left joins, but my situation is a bit more complicated (3 tables instead of just 2) and I struggle finding a way how to modify that solution for my needs.

This is simplified database schema:
[![enter image description here][1]][1]

item can be either in a box, standalone in a shelf, or in neither (not defined). Box can be in a shelf or not defined.

Ideally, I would use SQL query like this: (If I had OUTER JOIN in MySQL)

    SELECT *
    FROM item
    OUTER JOIN box ON box.b_id=item.i_id
    OUTER JOIN shelf ON (shelf.s_id=item.s_id) OR (shelf.s_id=box.s_id)
    WHERE ...

In `WHERE` I may dynamically add something like `box.b_id=42` or `item.i_name LIKE '%aaa%' AND item.s_id IS NOT NULL`

What I want to know is that, is there a better way than doing this:    

    if (keyLength=1){
    secretletter=a;
    if (keyLength=2){
    secretletter=b;

What I have done is below, but my for loop is wrong and I always end up with z. 


    public static char secret(String str,int keyLength){
        char secretletter = 0;
        if (keyLength>=0 && keyLength<27){
        for(char i='a'; i<='z';i++){
    	secretletter=i;
        }
    	
        }
    	return secretletter;
    }

"I am trying to display an article in a ViewController. 

The output that I receive from the API divides the article into paragraphs, and each paragraph is a node in the JSON. For example, 

    {
     ""para"" : 1,
     ""content"" : ""some long paragraph""
    },
    {
     ""para"" : 1,
     ""content"" : ""some long paragraph""
    }

I want to display this content as one long article, but I want to let each paragraph to be viewed in one textView instead of combining all the paragraphs and view in one textView. 

I am on Xcode 8, Swift 3. I use Cocoapods, so libraries are welcome. Thanks.

"So I am very new to android studio, I just started using it about a week or so ago. My problem is relatively simple, convert data from a text field into a integer. The goal of that int is to be used in a conditional statement. However I cannot seem to find an answer that works. This is where my code that i'm having problems with is.

"Newbie question. I am building a weather forecast app as part of learning to program in Swift. 

I have a protocol for passing a location back to my main forecast class to use to return a forecast for a certain location. I have two different classed that use the protocol when returning a location to return a forecast for.

I was having an issue that one of the classes would cause a crash for unwrapping a nil with regard to delegate to the forecast class. The other class, set up with exactly the same return function did not have this error. I tracked the crash down to the prepare(for segue: function in the forecast class. Because I did not need t pass information forward to one of the classes, I did not set **destinationViewController.delegate = self** for the class that crashed. My question is simply why did I have to set that in the forecast class in order to prevent the unwrapping a nil crash.

I know I missed something in why a protocol has to be set up this way, but I can't seem to find the answer as to why. I wanted to ask this question for me, and for others to find when this crash occurs.

I think this [post][1] addresses my issue, but does not answer the ""why,"" just the ""what."" What does setting the **destinationVC.delegate = self** in the class that initiates the segue do that setting **weak var delegate: ForecastTableViewController!** does not?

Thanks.

My code is as follows:

ForecastTableViewController class:

            destinationViewController.delegate = self
            destinationViewController.weatherData = self.weatherData

            destinationViewController.delegate = self

1. Assign a list of unique random numbers to 5 variables and 5 constants. (Not sure if the way I did it was right or if I should use

2. Place them in an array 

3. Sort by ascending order

4. Store them in a dictionary using key values to retrieve the highest and lowest number easily.

I can't really figure out, what exactly I've done wrong. I've followed the tipps from [another question of mine][1] and replaced all `new/delete` things with **smart pointers** (or at least I think I did).

The reason I ask is, because I've encountered an increase in my memory size and heap size while running my program and I'm not sure, if it is some serious problem or just some kind of basic behaviour. 

Take my (self written) gui for example:

    std::shared_ptr<Gui_Button> gui_modal_window_map_saved_button;

And I now call it with:

    gui_modal_window_map_saved_button.reset(new Gui_Button(res_handler, ""Select"", 20, 345, 70, 40, BUTTON_CONFIRM));

which has been told to be memory safe. Now, there's something that I am not really sure about - how do I safely delete the button now? I know, there's nothing like delete with smart pointers, but I think of deleting in the way of removing the button when it is not needed any longer, i.e. after the corresponding window has been closed. 

At the moment I'm ""deleting"" my button with `reset()` 

    if (g_ev.event_id == EVENT_CLICKED && g_ev.element == gui_modal_window_map_saved_button.get()) {
    		gui_modal_window_map_saved.reset();
    		gui_modal_window_map_saved_button.reset();
    	}

I thought that this was okay, but why is my memory size increasing (and not decreasing again) everytime a ""new"" button is created?

**Coming back to the original question**

I get these dumps of memory leaks by Visual Studio, but I really can't figure out how to use this information. What exactly causes a memory leak? I'm now using only ""normal"" pointers where I need to pass something to another class i.e., and replaced all `new/deletes` with smart pointers. I really can't show my code, because it is about 3000 lines so far.. 

So, what exactly causes memory leaks and how doI use the informations provided by VS?

    current = 0 + 1.5 = 1.5 = 1 #skip

what condition on line 118 (under todo section) will successfully #skip lines(as in logic) for f = 0.8 (first two lines to be skipped), f = 0.5 (no lines to be skipped) and f = 0.4 (only first line to be skipped).

If I open the excel file, everything is fine I see: COMPANY NAME, If I open the excel file with notepad++, I see the cell values this way: C(NUL)O(NUL)M(NUL)P(NUL)A(NUL)N(NUL)Y N(NUL)A(NUL)M(NUL)E
If I open again the file with excel and save, then reopen with notepad++ I see COMPANY NAME.
So I do not understan why every time I create an excel file using PHPEXCEL my every letter of all words are filled with (nul) every letter.
So how do I prevent the generated excel file to include (nul) between every word????
Also if you open the original excel file generated from PHPExcel samples are also filled with (nul) and if you open and save it, the (nul) is gone.

"I want to let people click on text in an HTML document, then send the click index back to the server.  Ideally I'd like to let people highlight a section of text and pop up a little dialog where they could comment on the text, and send the whole thing back to the server.  The next time the user signs in and accesses that page, they should see their highlight and their comment.

But really highlighting is extra.  The main thing is to get some measure I can save on the server, like a percentage through the HTML document where the user clicked so I can put any comments they make at least near that text the next time they sign in.

I understand that the offset may have to be relative to the plain text, or relative to a DOM selector.  I don't really care at this point.  Number of characters, % of document, I just need something to get started and I can improve on it later.

"I am very new to Java (2nd chapter) with very little instruction from class.  I need to check the users input for abbreviations.  The user enters a specific line at the beginning of the program and the IndexOf should not be used to recognize the abbreviations.  Any other input, the abbreviations should be recognized.  I've tried many, many variations and can't list them all, but here are two of my latest code efforts.  Scenario 1....The userInput1 is static.  The userInput should print out what the user inputs (system generated) and then put the abbreviations on different lines.  I'm not sure if I even need two variables, but that is the only way I can think of to separate the indexOf statements from the userInput1 variable.  But when this code runs, the userInput1 prints as output on every line.  Also, when the output prints what is inputted, only the first word is listed of the sentence.

Everything seems to be working for me except my intersectionWith function.
This is what is outputted when I run my code:

    is3 (intersection): {2, 4, 5, }
But what it needs to be is just {2, 5}
I am uncertain as how to how I am getting this error. Is there something wrong with my intersectionWith function?

"I am creating a fingerprint scanner. One of the ways of identifying a fingerprint could be through the use of SIFT. 

To do this I would need to store the original image file to a directory. To stop potential hackers I would need to restrict access to the files either by encrypting the images or stopping direct access to the image directory.

I would rather not encrypt the image files as this makes things a lot more complex.

"new here ! 
So i was running a jdbc code and trying to get a boolean return value from the execute(sql) method after updating my db table. Following is the code
     
    try{
		Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
		String sql = ""update emp_earnings set salary = 6400 where lower(name)= 'bob'"";
		Boolean result = stmt.execute(sql);
		System.out.println(""rows affected (Y/N): "" + result );
	}catch(Exception e){
		System.out.println(""some error in second"");
		e.printStackTrace();

when i check in my db table , the salary is updated but the execute(sql) has returned a 'false'.
I get an output as 'false' despite execute() working doing its job.
I checked the net , it says that it should return 'true' if worked. The executeUpdate() returns the 'no of rows affected' fine when i use that in the same code instead of execute() and is giving the required output.

"I have written a C++ program to find all the automorphic numbers (numbers which are repeated in the final digits of their squares such as **5x5**=2**5**, **76x76**=57**76**) from 1 to 111,111. The program runs fine except that it fails to give 90625 and 109376. The code is as follows:

    #include<cstdlib>
    #include<iostream>
    
    using namespace std;
    
    int main(){
    
    long int square;
    int a, sum=0, result, b;
    
    for(int i=1; i<111111; i++){
    
    result=1;
    b=i;
    
    while(b>0){
    b=b/10;
    result=result*10;
              }
    
    square=i*i;
    
    a=square%result;
    
    if(i==a){
        sum=sum+i;
        cout<<i<<endl;
             }
    }
    
    cout<<sum<<endl;
    
    return 0;
    }
